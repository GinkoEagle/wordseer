  Run marathons, am an optimist - 29 (Upper East Side)
</title>
<text>
		I run marathons and am very ambitious with my goals. Am well educated, and when I am not engaged in good conversation, love museums and coffee shops. 

Also have a very funny and unique way for us to meet: Trying to join a grad school group where the last remaining task is that I have to find someone whom I have never met and kiss their feet, told you it was funny! 

So that is about me, intrigued?
