  Summer romance? - 20
</title>
<text>
		Hey there!
I've been single for a while now and well, I'm starting to miss the whole 'getting to know each other' and 'growing together' sha-bang that you get when speaking to a possible suitor.
About me.. I'm 20, a student and I'm from East London. I'm white, 6'3" and have that whole 'Ruggedly handsome' thing going on! (We're allowed to sell ourselves a bit, right? :P) I'm also quite possibly the most laid back person you'd ever have met! 

Honestly, I have absolutely no real preferences when it comes to a woman. As long as you're able to keep me wanting to come back with your personality, we'll be just fine. 
With that being said, of you wanted to send a picture, I'd surely send you one back. 
Reply with 'Summer Romance' in the subject tab so I know what to expect. 
I look forward to your emails! (:
