  Seeking Soulmate for LTR (which goes without saying in Soulmate Land) - 41 (North London)
</title>
<text>
		Very young looking 41 year old. 
I'm into music and do various things in that field some of the time. Like trip -hop, beats and samples ,old skool hip-hop.  Also in the last year I got into enjoying the gym and training more then I ever had before and equally, healthy nutrition- so that has become a big part of my life.
I am funny (not continually, but generally quick witted) and enjoy word play. Ultimately looking for someone quick witted with your own unique brand of a sense of humour, someone attractive who looks after themself, healthy, around my own age, intelligent, hot, individual, single, caring and available for something substantial...please send a recent pic with your response, thank you.
