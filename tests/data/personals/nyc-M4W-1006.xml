  Taking clothes off isn't always a bad thing, even if it's platonic. - 30 (New York)

		My question would be which type are you, more free with your body or on the shy side. Do you always have to have clothes on even around your own house? If you're open to hanging out with a white guy, slim, normal and sane, drop me a line. When you reply change the subject so you don't get email blocked. Please be thin and under 35.
