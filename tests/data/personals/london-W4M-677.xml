		Hi there

This is totally out of character for me but i thought why not what's the harm.
I'm a 19 year old indian girl from London. I am looking for someone to have dates with and develop into long term relationship. I have never had serious bf before and sometime find it hard to meet new people.

I work in a call centre and study part time. I like to play tennis and swimming. Love going to cinema and reading books. I am more indoors girl than party animal.

Look forard to hearing from you.
