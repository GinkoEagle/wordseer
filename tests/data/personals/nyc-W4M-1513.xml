  Cute, fun SBF seeks charming SBM or SWM - 33 (Midtown)
</title>
<text>
		Hello!  I'm an easygoing, adventurous young professional black woman seeking an intelligent, cultured guy for some fun in NYC (dining, movies, live music, museums, etc.).  Looking for something that could potentially become an LTR if things go well.

I'm 5'5" and have been described as "slender with curves in the right places" :)  If you're a SBM or SWM age 28-40 feel free to drop me a line.  I'll only respond to those who include their age, a physical description and say something more than just "hi"... Your pic gets mine!
