  A lady seeks a gentleman ...  - 37 (London)
</title>
<text>
		...for friendship to possible long-term relationship.

Friends describe me as fun, loyal, excellent sense of humour with a hint of sarcasm, full of life and energy, up for great laughs and enjoy most things in life [usually sensibly LOL!].

I like my man tall-ish [although I am not tall myself, haha!], between the age of 35-45 preferably with blue/green/hazel eyes [dreamy would be good too :D], fit/slim build and white Caucasian.  

If the above resonates with you, then drop me a line describing yourself and interests and see where we shall go from there.  Oh, just another thing, I am of Chinese descent ... and not from China :P
