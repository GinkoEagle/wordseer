</title>
<text>
		Hi 
This is Silvia from west London.I am 32 years of age.I am 5'8" tall wilt slim body structure.I am lovely  to look at with brown hair and green eyes.I am now a single parent.I have got separation 3 months ago.Now I am living a very independent life with my 3-years old baby.I got separation from my husband because he was very much dominating.That is why we cannot adjust.
I am very much open minded and easy to understand.I never love dominating.I love to enjoy life with someone very much understanding and open minded.To understand me I am here telling some of my likinigs:Cooking,travelling,music,driving,reading and to make people laugh.And finally as a mother I am ready to do anything for my child.
Now you can say why I am looking for a new life partner.Because I realize that a new partner is necessary not only for me but also for my child so that he can grow up in a complete family where there will be love,happiness everything.
I can asure you that you will not face any financial responsibility for my child because I am financially in good condition and I am self dependant woman.I am running a small restaurant.
