		No social experiment here. Nor am I trying to integrate the world. We're all drawn to individuals for our own particular reasons. 

5'4, full-figured, stilt (stiletto) walker in her early 30s who already embodies all the things the Tin Man, Scarecrow and Cowardly Lion were off seeking. 

Only the right guys need respond with the right reasons! Late 20s to mid 40s preferably. 

Happy searching.
