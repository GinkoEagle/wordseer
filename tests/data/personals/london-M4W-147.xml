  Mr Average; looking for his girl - 27 (Kingston)
</title>
<text>
		I'm Andy, 5'9'' 27 and a professional writer. I'm looking for something serious but am open minded, I'm a genuine and decent guy, extremely honest and fun to be around. I don't care about looks, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, or at least that's how I feel.
If you want someone who'll treat you with respect and decency then look no further.

Message me with a picture and I'll reply, please no dating sites, UK only. 
Please no spammers also, its fairly obvious its a fake message when the 'girl' puts a dodgy looking email address in the first message and the attached picture is blank.
