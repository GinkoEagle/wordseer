		Looking for a gentle white man to spend some exquisite time with. I love romance and I want a likeminded soul to build these memories with. 
Me: 5'7, plus size, black with locs. 
You: 6' or taller, kind, smart but not pedantic, funny and interesting. I am looking for white man because I want to experience something different. 
No drugs or alcohol abuse, ddfree, sane. Send a picture, and a paragraph telling me a little bit about you.
