		Hello, i am 26 years old and looking for ... not sure exactly but something fulfilling. I was born and raised in NYC and moved to NC about 3 years ago. I'm moving back to NYC within a few weeks (thank god) and i'm just trying to find someone special. I'm mixed black, white and dominican, I am almost finished getting my degree in psychology. Since living in NC I have come across some strange "southern belles". We rarely had anything in common, and most of them had multiple kids and a few "baby dadies". And i'm not trying to judge anyone but thats just not the type of woman i'm looking for. A little about myself, I love sports, movies, cooking, and im kind of a nerd (I like reading, science.. etc). I'm pretty ambitious but i also know how to have fun. What i'm looking for, to be honest most of my girlfriends have been white, or hispanic. (black girls say I dress to preppy, speak like a "white boy" and have mostly white friends). So if thats a problem too bad. I'm 5'10", i workout and have a pretty nice body. I'm really smart, and enjoy making people laugh. Here are a few pics, if you like what you see hit me up. No pic- no response. There are too many bots out here.
