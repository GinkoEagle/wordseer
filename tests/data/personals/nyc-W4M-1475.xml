  Uber + Quasi - 36 (manhattan)
</title>
<text>
		Uber-smart and witty
Uber-single
Uber-kind and considerate

Quasi-fit (not really into super muscular, just someone who exercises regularly, and spends time developing his mind as well.... btw i'm slim and work out)
Quasi-tall (5'9" and over is fine, since I'm around 5'6')
Quasi-modo (hope not!)

No offense, but just know I'm attracted to Caucasian men on the professional side around the same age or slightly older.
