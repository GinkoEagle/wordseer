		Middle aged male looking for a relationship with a woman between the ages 43-55 years of age. I am a laid back, easy going kinda guy. I am looking for some one who shares similar interests in life such as walking in the park, going to concerts, going out to eat, or watch movies. I am 5'10 on the slim side, as I am looking for a woman on the slim side like myself. If you're also looking for a serious relationship and would like to meet a real character, you won't be dissappointed meeting me. Please email me if interested, I am looking forward speaking with you. Email: Todd746aol.com. Have a great day.
