Ray Donovan, Sons of Anarchy, Newsroom, VEEP, Happy Endings, Boss

steak, enfp, spring and fall, low key, spontaneous moments

hiit, stuff thats not too far from hiit, weights, explore, pretty things

cooking, life hacks, wordplay, cuddles, corny factor, cool factor, humanitarian, principles

guilty pleasures, cheap thrills, great ideas, life learner, people watching

clueless, intuition, happy


I'm real, looking  for something worth having be it a friendship, a little more, or who knows
if we're in the same vein, couldn't hurt to send me a message. But if you're going to, please say more than hi and please send a pic. I do reply to real messages
