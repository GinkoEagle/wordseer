  Gigs London - 28 (London)
</title>
<text>
		Hi

I am looking for a female partner in crime to go to several gigs a month / week. Also willing to go to venues you regularly attend and even venture out to festivals. Often travel alone to and from gigs with no company to talk about music and life with. I don't often make small talk with strangers at these gigs so looking for someone in a similar kind of position into the similar kind of music: mainly rock, but I am open to all kinds of music.

As long as you enjoy live music, are pretty laid-back and won't mind a drink or two pre, during and post-gig time, and you're aged between 20-30, do get in touch.

Cheers!
