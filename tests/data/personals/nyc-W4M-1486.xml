  Looking for guys that love their moms and no history of divorce - 36 (NNJ)
</title>
<text>
		Simply looking for a down to earth, witty, intelligent guy with good manners, not crude or rude.

Must like the simple things in life.

Must not be jaded and knows what he wants out of life, relationships and friendships.

This is more of a friendship first arrangement.

Must be a good communicator. I prefer substance .

If you are the type I can bring home to mom, then email me.

Please type substance in the subject area so I know you actually read this.
Also, please let me know what your type is. 

By the way I'm african american and latin.

Please don't send rude or pictures not smiling or creepy ones. They will be spammed immediately.
