  Black lady looking for a white gentleman - 48 (East / Central London)
</title>
<text>
		I am a young looking, attractive, curvy, 48 year old black woman.  I am looking for a white man (my preference) who is my age or older.  I am five foot seven in height, so you should be a taller than me.  You must be single, nice looking, loyal, trustworty, financially secure, kind, caring, willing to look after and pamper me!  I like going to restuarants and bars, shopping, (which woman doesn't like being treated and taken shopping?!)  I also like going to the theatre.  If you think you are the man I am looking for, please contact me.  I am only looking for a white man, with the above qualities.  This is a genuine ad, so no time wasters.
