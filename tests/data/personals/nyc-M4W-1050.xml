  Dating Partner :) - 36 (Manhattan)
</title>
<text>
		I am interested in finding someone to have a regular date night with and see where it goes. Someone that I can get together with once a week and do typical date stuff with. Movie, dinner, show, drinks etc. Simple stuff like that. Not looking to rush right into a relationship just someone to go out with once a week and see if we hit it off. :).

I am looking for a cute female who lives in Manhattan who is interested in the same. I dont live in the city I live in Staten Island but work in the LES so I am looking for someone to go out with after work.  Exchange texts with during the week. Nothing serious. Just someone to share some good times and laughs with. I am young look/feeling 36, white, cute. If interested send me a email and ill get back to you. Your picture gets mine.
