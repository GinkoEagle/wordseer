<text>
		White 35 year old bbw looking for a nice, and preferably sane guy for something that would hopefully develop into a Ltd. I'm a big girl, around a size 26, 5'8, long bright red curly hair. I'm a nice girl and don't tend to have trouble attracting people but what tends to put them off is the fact that I am HIV positive. I figured I might as well give craigslist a go as it seems to be where all the open minded people hang out. Anyway, if there are any of you out there, I'd love tho years from you. A pic would be nice and you may get one in return. More than one line would also be good. If you could put 'I read it' in the subject box I'll know you actually read my advert, thanks:)
