  Never had a GF - 26 (London)

		Hi thanks for reading.

Can't believe I've resorted to this but maybe I can find someone life me online. I've never had a gf, sad I know. Not because I'm hideous  or a weirdo, I actually have a great personality. I'm not bad looking either but I guess thats subjective as everyone had different tastes. I am usually the guy that ends up in the 'Friend Zone', partly because I'm a good friend and listener so girls feel like they can talk to me and they don't want to ruin it by going out with me. You won't believe how annoying that is. Anyway I'm looking to date, go out and have a relationship with someone. I'm inexperienced when it comes to relationships but I'm an inteligent  guy so I can figure it out as I go.

I'm down to earth, great sense of humour, witty and fun loving. I am a social person, into most things.



If you are interested get in touch.
