  Date with an educated, nice guy - 29 (London)
</title>
<text>
		Hello, I'm a 29 y.o girl staying in London for a few weeks and I certainly don't know many people. If you are nice British/European/American guy who enjoys conversation and culture and is between 25-35 years old, I'd like to meet you and have coffee or dinner. I'm just looking for a good chat and who knows, we may like each other and feel up for some nsa fun. No guarantees though since I'd like to know the guy first! Write me with "educated guy" in the subject so I know you are not a spammet or troll, please. Also, if you don't bother spelling properly or writing more than one line I won't reply...
