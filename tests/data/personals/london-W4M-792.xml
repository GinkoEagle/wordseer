  Looking for an American penpal, but I'll let it slide if you're not - 20 (England)

		I'm looking for an intelligent, cultured and funny male (preferably from America) to converse with. I have penpals from all over the world (primarily Europe) but I've realised no one from the States which I find to be such a pity.
You could in a sense liken me to Angelina Jolie, expect I don't wish to adopt any of you unfortunately.

I would consider myself to be friendly and polite with a dark sense of humour. I'm slightly quirky, but not in a serial murderer way (Though if you get on my wrong side...I kid). I love literature, theater, film, food and music.

If you've been impressed by what you've read, feel free to send me a message. I shan't discriminate on age, race, nationality etc etc
