		Hi
Im at the stage in my life now where I would like to spend some time in good company with an interesting articulate guy who doesnt want to sit in front of the tv every night. I have varied interests and believe that I can hold a decent conversation, saying that I'm not looking to email for ages, more to see quite quickly if we like the sound of each other then arrange to meet to see if we were right. I'm in my 40's but welcome emails from any age as I dont think it should be a problem (as long as I'm not old enough to be your mother..awkward...and not young enough to be your daugher!)
Not sure if this is the right place for an ad like this but thought I'd give it a try, lets prove the sceptics wrong.
