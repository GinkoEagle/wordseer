  Looking for an amazing girl - 29 (sw)
</title>
<text>
		I've been single for a while and I would like an amazing girl to come into my life and turn it round for the better.
A bit about me- I'm 29, 5'8" tall, slim, white. I enjoy sports, music, movies, comedy, restaurants. I'm not much of a clubbing person and would rather spend an evening in a nice restaurant with some good company.
What am I looking for- someone my age or younger, white (just personal preference), non smoker/drug user. I'm looking for someone who is kind and caring. It will be a bonus if you like hugs (I like giving hugs).
Maybe we could go for a drink or meal and see if there is any chemistry?
Reply if interested or if you would like to know more.
