  Seeking chap for a dance and a shipwreck - 25 (London)
</title>
<text>
		Hello

I would describe myself as a bookish sort, but in the good way, not bad: this means I am curious, literate and engaging, rather than socially inept and lacking in Vitamin D. My curiosity extends to all walks of life, however; I love meeting new people (yes, but who doesn't) and learning about this city. I love food markets as well and go to theatre a lot.

I am looking to meet a man who has hobbies (preferably those that match mine, though any display of intellectual curiosity will do), charm and no emotional baggage. If I was the sort to put arbitrary conditions on potential soulmates, I'd ask that you are upwards of 28 and quit tall.
