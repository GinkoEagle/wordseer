Please do not email me if you are not interested in a LTR.
The intent is for me to move to the UK (No Visa seekers please. I will not sponsor).
Email exchanges first then hopefully phone calls to follow.

Please respond with some information about yourself and what matters most to you in a woman. Guys seeking the perfect body, please don't respond. I would like to find a relationship with someone who is seeking a soul mate.
