  TONIGHT FREE DRINKS at Leicester Square (London)
</title>
<text>
		If you live/work in around Leicester square / Covent garden / Piccadilly and if you don't have any better plan for tonight would you mind joining me for a drinks or two and chat? A friend has just cancelled the dinner tonight so I am bit loose end this evening. Would be nice to meet someone for a drinks chat and laughter.

Well, little bit about me - I am 35 an easygoing open minded guy that works for a law firm in the city.

If you are interested please send me an email fairly quickly should you want to meet.
