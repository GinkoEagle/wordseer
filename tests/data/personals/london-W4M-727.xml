		Hi,

Thank you for reading this. I have reached a point where I am tired of looking after myself and need a strong man to take over. 

I am not looking for a long lets get to know each other over email sort of thing, but a talk over the phone, have one coffee and move in together. That is the only way we would know each other. 

Ideally you are lonely, caring and willing to enjoy the company of a happy go lucky woman who wants to feel at home in your strong arms. 

I wont attest to being a great cook but I am domestic goddess with an adventurous streak in the bedroom. Ideally looking for someone within the SW area as that is where I have a job.

Me: Black woman, early 30's, 5'2 dress size 8 and very affectionate and loving.
You:  29-40 and have your own place where we can get up to whatever we like. Good job and are willing to provide for my every need!!

Looking forward to meeting my life partner....
