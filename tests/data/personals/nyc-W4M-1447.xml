  Attractive and Successful SBF - 28
</title>
<text>
		Why is it so difficult to meet people in this city?  I've tried CL a couple of times and it's not really my style, but I'm kind of at a loss for how to proceed with meeting a nice stable guy.  I'd like a long term relationship which starts out as a simple mutual attraction/friendship.  

A bit about me- I am average height, fit, long hair, dimples, incredibly long eyelashes and the whitest teeth you'll ever see (or so I'm told). :)  Your pic gets mine.
