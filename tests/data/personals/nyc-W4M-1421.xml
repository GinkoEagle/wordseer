  Real Woman Seeks Real Man for LTR - 52 (Southwestern Long Island)
</title>
<text>
		I'm looking for one good man who is honest, sincere, kind and intelligent for a long-term relationship. I am a 52 y.o. SWF (divorced ) with dark hair, tall, large framed and told I am attractive (inside & out). My interests include movies, dining out or in, the beach, occasional trips to the city or just spending a quiet evening at home. Please be over 50, have a sense of humor and your own means of support. Not into nightclubs or gym rats. I'm not perfect and don't expect you to be but please be sane and drama-free. It doesn't matter too much what you look like on the outside as much as what you look like on the inside. NO MARRIED MEN!!! If you are a teddy-bear type you get extra points! Have a great day and I hope to hear from you .
