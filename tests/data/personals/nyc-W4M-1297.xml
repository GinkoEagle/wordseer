  Seeking the too busy and lonely (Downtown)
</title>
<text>
		BBW searching for a Clean Cut, White/Caucasian, who is either too busy with his career and has no time for a girlfriend and not into hopping into bed with a stranger every night (which can be quite unfulfilling) and would like to have someone regular but without the commitment, No drama and just some good old fun companionship without all the hangups of the traditional relationship of BF/GF. Please understand that I'm seeking something ongoing/regular with only ONE guy and fun OUTSIDE of the bedroom as much as INSIDE. Busy traveling Executives/Businessmen are also welcomed someone who would enjoy the company of this BBW while you are here. 

 I'm a Larger/Bigger Asian BBW (around 225 pounds size 18/20) in her early 40's searching for a White/Caucasian male between 35-50 yrs old, but open to someone outside this range if attraction and chemistry is there. Please be in the Manhattan, preferably Downtown, area and you MUST host. You are DDF, Non Smoker. Contact me with some info/stats about yourself and let's chat. I'm only willing to meet initially for Coffee/Drinks/Dinner to see if chemistry is there.
