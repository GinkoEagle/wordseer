  Asian Girl Looking for Laidback White Guy - 28 (CT/NYC)
</title>
<text>
		Long story short, I'm an Asian female looking for a laidback guy to date in hopes of a long term relationship. I currently live in CT and commute into NYC for work. Yeah, I know this is Craigslist so that might be asking for a lot. In theory, if you can find your apt and sell some concert tickets on here, why can't Craigslist find you a boyfriend or girlfriend or at least someone to date and see where it goes?

Me:
Chinese
5'8
28
Bachelor's Degree
Enjoys traveling, reading, working out, going out, watching/playing sports


You:
5'8 or taller
White
Late 20s or early 30s in Age
At least a Bachelor's Degree

Please send me a pic and what you're looking for in a woman.
