</title>
<text>
		Hey all east indian girl here doing a blanket post type of thing on pof and okc trying this out to see what its like. I'm in grad school hence the lack of being a millionaire but by no means am I looking for $ or exchange of services or any weird stuff like that. Just looking for someone older than 30 who is smart and fun to talk to. 

P.S. You understand that we are busy with our lives but know that you want to find someone you can look forward to spending those free moments with...laugh with...cook with...eat with... hang out with...you get the picture.

P.P.S. send a pic and a subject heading that will stand out

I'm obviously not 99 years old...
