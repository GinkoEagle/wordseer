  MWM Seeking Married or single , Looks or Race Unimportant - 50 (westchester and beyond)
</title>
<text>
		Well, I'm not meeting any one  while squeezing the cantaloupes and grapefruits when I go food shopping on Sundays but it DOES remind me of what I miss about a woman, besides some nice walks , Nor am I getting any offers while at my kids Parent/Teacher meetings ,kids are grown now 

Alright, so enough goofing around I think I'm a kind hearted, reliable guy who is at a point in my life , I never expected to be married but feel single. I've done all the right things for my family ,good father, yet life doesn't always follow the path that you map out so here I am on this site looking to make one friend .
No you won't find me on the cover of GQ although that was difficult to turn down but just didn't need the publicity at the time , all kidding aside,  I would like to think im just a descent guy in person but leave that up to the face to face experience!  married guy seeking friend
