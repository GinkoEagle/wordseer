  LOOKING FOR A WOMAN WHO IS INTO PHILOSOPHY AND METAPHYSICS - 29 (South London)
</title>
<text>
		I'm looking for a woman who is into philosophy and metaphysics and enjoys long deep conversations.
Someone with an open and positive mind towards things in life.
Someone who can look past the commercialization of the planet and look at things from a different perspective.

Myself I am a black guy in late 20s from South London.
I'm into creative writing, metaphysics and philosophy. 
Even though I have always been into and live in the stream of consciousness.
I have been getting deeper and deeper into over the years as things have been changing in my life.

Apart from this I also like water and motor sports and I like learning new things.

If you are interested in a relationship get in touch Hotep.
