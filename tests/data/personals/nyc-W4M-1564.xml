  looking to be saved - 34 (queens)
</title>
<text>

As my friends all marry, have kids, and have normal lives,  I find myself frozen in time and self relecting. I still act 22, love to party, can be self absorbed and while I have a career I admit im pretty immature. Every relationship I have had has been abusive, I have been cheated on, lied to you name it. So ive become withdrawn from relationships bc i dont have to deal with being hurt. I drink way too much, have abandonment issues and trust issues. I have a hard time letting go even when I know something is wrong for me. I recognize my flaws. But with my flaws, I have a heart of gold and so much love to give. I long for someone to make me feel secure and loved so I dont have to be that needy girl with low self esteem.  I long for someone to help me overcome all of the trauma I have endured and truly accept me and love me despite my imperfections. 

I dont expect to get any real responses but it felt good to vent. Maybe one day I will find what I am looking for. Until then, back to self destruction :)
