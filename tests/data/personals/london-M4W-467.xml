  Young white guy seeking female - m4w - 20 (London)

		Hey, due to my utter shyness of approaching attractive women in person, I thought this would be the best place for me to start talking!
Well, I'm a 20 year old student studying psychology and living in East London. I'm pretty active, often playing basketball with a few friends (being 6'3" is quite handy!) 
I'm interested in speaking with, possibly meeting, a girl around my age, 30 probably being the upper limit. My preference would be shorter than 5'8", some meat on your body, quite witty with a great sense of humor and a little bit of a nerd from time to time. Oh, and having the ability to converse would be a plus! xD
Well, if you think you would be interested, message me back with a little bit about yourself and we could swap a few photo's so we know who we're dealing with.
I look forward to reading your emails (:
