  Date with a stranger!
</title>
<text>
		Hi!

Its a lovely day outside and I have time on my hand today so thought it would be a good idea to do spend some time with a nice and interesting stranger;)
Anyone else feels the same?
May be we could have a couple of drinks in a pub garden and see how things go from there. No pressure from either side...just chilling and leaving the rest to destiny.

I am a professional male in my mid 30s. I am easygoing, friendly, funloving, down to earth and do know how to have a good laugh. Your age does not matter as long as you are grounded and know how to have a good laugh too. Please dont just be a teenager or my granny's age:)

Drop me a note if interested and let make full use of this lovely day. Who knows...we might just connect;)
