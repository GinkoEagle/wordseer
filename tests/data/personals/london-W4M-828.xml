<text>
		...Ex-public school boy. MUST BE SINGLE..London based, well mannered and great fun -certainly is a must. Please be between 30- 36yrs old,well groomed, taller than 6ft1 and easy on the eyes! I dislike poor time keeping and arrogance. Somebody who loves being social -long dinners/dinner parties with lots of humour and laughter, lively debates, social awareness. I am interested in somebody who have  emotional capacity.

 I am a big flurt, pretty laid back, practical, well rounded,honest and to the point (hate having my time wasted )-thus not having time for any ' hooray Henry's...Tarquins or anybody in need of a 'gap yah' ...please be warm and engaging.If getting to know a person is too much like hard work,, it usually is not worth the effort. I am certainly not hard work, if you are, then move on....Respond with a picture.

PS: FOR THOSE LOOKING FOR NSA...PLEASE MOVE ON!!!
