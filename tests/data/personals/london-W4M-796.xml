  Looking at the sky!!! - (london  )
</title>
<text>
		Oh! Look at the sky! It's your first friend and support. It rains when you are sad in order you wouldn't feel so lonely. It greets you with a sun shine in the morning and cover you with soft blanket when you are going to sleep. It sings you a song of a winds, of a winds all around the world in order to favor you with a wisdom of the universe, in order to give you a sense of life, hope, desire and adventure for the next day, to inspire you for writing poems, song and even novels. Because your life is one big and compelling novel which you create by yourself.
