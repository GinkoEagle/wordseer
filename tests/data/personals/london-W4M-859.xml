  Attractive girl looking to meet a decent guy for a relationship - 30
</title>
<text>
		I'm an attractive 30 years old, professional black female living and working in London. I am single, never been married and no kids either.

I am pretty easy going, you would always find me with a smile on my face, I enjoy cooking, as I find it quite therapeutic, I also read a love, I love cycling which I do everyday, I am an animal lover and I do have an adorable jack russell terrier, who really is the person you want to impress:-) I enjoy eating out like most everyone else, I prefer going to pubs and bars as supposed to night clubs... I love escaping the city for a nice country break and I do that as often as I can... ..My friends would describe me as loyal, thoughtful and a happy person. I don't take myself too seriously and I can always take a joke.


I'm looking to meet a good looking professional guy aged between 32-40 to go on dates with and see how things progress. I would guy who's company I thoroughly enjoy, someone who respects his partner and is affectionate towards her. He would be settled in life, and focused about his goals and ambitions...

Pls don't sent me "hey babe" response. Email me with a picture, telling me more about yourself as I have described myself and what you are looking for. And we'll take it from there

I haven't posted my pic on here for privacy reason. But I'm happy to send a pic if you include yours in your response

I will not respond to one or two line replies or the ones without pictures
