  Sat morning & I'm in the office  - 40 (N London)

		Yesterday was a very good day at work. Completed two acquisitions & staff threw a surprise BBQ & gave me a "thank you for being a great boss" card. All good you'd say. But then I went home and it all felt a bit flat. I had no one to share my happiness with. No one to share all the details with. Sharing is one of the best things about being in a relationship.So here I am seeing if anyone out there would like to take me out on a date. 

Key facts about me - 5ft,5in, 9.5st, non smoker, teetoal, short hair, single, no kids, no car, atheist, hardworking, tactile, allergic to cats & dogs, positive thinker, carnivore who loves fruits, doesn't like coffee and is addicted to a cup'a tea! 

If you are interested, reply with a couple of short paragraphs about yourself. A photo would be helpful. I'll send you photos of my if you ask nicely.
