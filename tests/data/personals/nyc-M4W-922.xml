		If a guy finds somebody who has done everything already, where's the fun in learning together. It's also not safe and would make me feel like she's been around way too much. I like the idea of kind of showing someone how things are different with different people. Just because you've been with one guy that did something you may have not been into doesn't mean that will happen with everybody. My description is 5'9, slim with dark hair and eyes. Send me a reply with yours and please be a non-smoker. By the way, that's not all I'm about, I'm actually into the arts, musical and fun to be around. :)
