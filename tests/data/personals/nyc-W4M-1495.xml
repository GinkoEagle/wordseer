  One Love - 24 (LI)
</title>
<text>
		Dear Prince Charming, 

I have looked for many days now to find you. I am tired of the same hurtful guys. I am looking for a guy who is sweet, caring, and can be trusted. A guy who has a good job, car possibly and finally wants a long term serious relationship that will lead to marriage. This guy must be between the ages of 24 to 32. Also the guy must be white sorry preference. Also please put in the subject of your email your favorite song, 

Sincerely, 

Andrea
