<text>
		We're in one of the remaining weekends of the Summer and I'm tired of the bar scene.  I'm at a point where I really want to meet a great guy to get serious with.  Friends first, of course.  I'm really fun, enjoy going out and staying to a quiet evening. I have a lot to bring to a relationship. Put your favorite genre of music in the subject. Include your picture. If all works well, we should meet up soon.
