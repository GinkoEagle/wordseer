</title>
<text>
		I been widowed too long. I am looking for a man with a hairy chest who can cook. must be intelligent because I need someone to discuss current events. like to travel, but needs to nest.
I like Las Vegas but not to gamble. the house always win. I like the shows, the buildings, the food buffets. the pictures are about 2 years old. 
I am looking for a stable man my age group. no puppies.
