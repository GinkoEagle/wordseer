  Italian moving to London - 40 (Rome-London)
</title>
<text>
		Hi there!
I am an Italian female from Rome Italy who decided to move to London. About me... I am attractive, smart, well travelled, well educated, great sense of humor, artistic, love cooking and wine... and all the other plesures in life. :) 
I work in the fashion business. I spent a few years in L.A., then came back to Rome but I guess I am not fullfilled. 
I am making arrangements for housing and jobs... it would just be so nice to know somebody there.... I don't know anyone in London.
I'll be happy if you reply with a pic a something about yourself... your pic gets mine!

Have a rocking day!
