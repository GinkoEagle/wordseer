  Hey There, SBF Searching for A SWM (Fairfield County, CT)
</title>
<text>
		Hi,

I am a single, black, female in search of a long term relationship with a single, white, male. I'm in my late 20's. I'm seeking a single male from their late 20's to about age of 35. I'm looking to have fun in a relationship. I'm looking to explore new things and new ideas. I'm a very respectful and intelligent individual.

I'm looking for someone who is not married, single, and who doesn't have kids. I'm attracted to guys who aren't afraid to say what they feel. I really respect honesty. I'm attracted to slender males. I'm looking for someone who seriously wants to eventually be in a committed relationship, but get to know each other first.

Please type SWM in the box.
Thanks
