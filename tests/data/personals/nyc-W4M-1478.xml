</title>
<text>
		I'm a single professional woman of Haitian descent who lives in Brooklyn and works in Manhattan;  I'm seeking friend for French conversation and exploring the city.  I do speak a little french but I'm not fluent and would like to be.

We could meet for drinks or just walk around the city and talk about various subjects.

If you're interested, please tell me a little about yourself and you're knowledge of  French so we can get started.

A bientot!
