  Full figured woman looking for LTR - - 44 (london)
</title>
<text>
		Hi there. I put full figured cause I just really don't like BBW, or being labeled. I'm a big girl, and I'm also tall at 5'8. I've been looking for 'my guy' for a while, and although I've met some nice guys, I've not met Mr right yet. I'm 44 years young, live alone, all by myself in my own place, and drive my own car. I'm financially secure and drama free. I'm looking for a good guy who is looking for someone like me. Reply with a pic and you'll get one back.

Just a note for those who are not aware of the acronym, LTR. It means long term relationship. This is ultimately what I wish for. Not a quickie, or a hook up or a little afternoon delight. A real guy who is wishing he had a girl who is interested in spending quality time with him.
