		So I am a normal guy, who should know better than posting on CL or to want to meet someone from here. But hey I have no plans. Are you in the same boat?. Sane, sweet, attractive, intelligent, but I am going stir crazy, wishing I was cuddling with someone now. I am feeling adventurous and want to meet a sweet stranger to have fun and cuddle with tonight.
I am looking for someone similarly sweet and sane who is also saying what the heck, I just need someone to hold me for a change. (But please have standards... ie there should be attraction, chemistry, conversation and more) Is what I am looking for even possible? Please be the best mistake I ever made lol. Tell me a little about you. Let's talk and maybe meet and fall asleep in each others arms tonight. Physically I am attractive, white 5'10, dark brown hair... I have pics for trade
