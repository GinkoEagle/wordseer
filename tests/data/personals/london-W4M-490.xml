		Just want meet someone new, that I can enjoy being around, can talk on phone about random stuff etc and not get bored! If there any genuine guys out there that decent looking likes to go out but also cuddle In; without the pressure of having to label whether we're in relationship or not. If this sounds like you then get in touch 

My preference is black or Irish
Not Asians sorry!!
Between 22-32
