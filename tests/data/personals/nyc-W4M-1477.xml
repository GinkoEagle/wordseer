<text>
		Black woman with HSV seeks LOVE with SBM, if you dont mention your HSV status I will not reply. Do not ask me what hsv is, your will be deleted immediately. I am very real and repost because I have not met the right man for me, I get alot of one word replies, pics without details, etc. I will not reply to those who have not really read my email, understand it and seeking the same as I am

I am searching for a life partner and something very serious. You must be able to travel to the suburbs to meet and open to relocating to the south asap

If you cannot travel by car or bus please do not contact me, I don't live inside the city

I am a homebody seeking the same in a mate

This is not a sugar mama situation if you are not employable, and open to relocation we are not a match

If you arent interested in something very serious please don't reply

Send a pic and I will reply with one and very detailed message, if you dont send a pic with a detailed message in your initial reply I will not respond, all others will be responded to right away
