  Very Attractive SBF Seeks Attractive SWM - 28
</title>
<text>
		Hello- I'm a very attractive and successful black woman who has a thing for white guys.  However, white guys aren't as open in approaching me for dates.  Unfortunately OKcupid doesn't have an option where you can view "white men interested in black women" (they should work on that). So, alas, my last resort is craigslist.  If you are a cute white guy interested in black women, send me a pic for a pic.  I'd like to get to know you and see if we have mutual interests.
