  Indian male looking for an Indian female - 27 (Jersey city/NYC)
</title>
<text>
		I am a 27 year old Indian guy. I am educated and I work in the IT like most Indian guys do. I recently relocated to Jersey City from NC and I am 100% lonely here in Jersey city. I am looking for a good Indian female friend who likes to roam around the city with me on weekends, visit various places in and around NY and NJ.
