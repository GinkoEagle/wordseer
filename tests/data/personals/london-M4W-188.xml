  Canadian - 57 (Cov/Gdn)

<text>
		I live part of the year in London, the other part in the US and Asia. When in London I live and work in Soho/ Cov gdn

I am in the media business, self employed. I like jazz/ theatre/ opera/ ballet. but most of all sitting in a cafe and watching the world go by.

I am looking for a slim easy going young woman to hang around with, and maybe develop a meaningful relationship, and if the that does not work out, a meaningless one will do as well !!!
