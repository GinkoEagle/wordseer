  Youthful maturity - 50 (Manhattan)
</title>
<text>
		I'm seeking a kindred spirit with youthful maturity to be my last first date.

I'm told that I am attractive and I know that I am smart. I am a native NYer and still gasp when I see the skyline from the air. 

I'd love to find that man to share this wonderful city with. We can even start with a drink tonight. Margarita, martini, Manhattan, Merlo???

No married men or smokers. Please send a picture or description and we can take it from there.
