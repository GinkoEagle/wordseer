  Looking for EDM dance mate Sunday! - 43 (Union Square)

		I have an extra ticket to see Paul van Dyk tomorrow and am looking for someone who 1) likes EDM  2) knows PvD  3) has been to a rave.

Nothing beyond tomorrow expected but NOT looking to spend the day with a man in a relationship.  Call me old fashioned, but that's not cool.

Went to my first rave 21 years ago. Look surprisingly young and fit for a party girl who works hard and plays hard. Seems having a fun job and eating healthy, sans drama c'est tout bon pour moi.
