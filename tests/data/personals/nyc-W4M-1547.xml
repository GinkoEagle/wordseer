		I find myself with no plans tonight and don't want to sit at home. That's where you come in. Let's go out, to a nice restaurant, have a great time and enjoy eachother's company.

As for me, I am cute, educated, well traveled, great sense of humor, down to earth and fun to be around.

You: Should be no older than your late 40's, educated, a good conversationalist, like to laugh and have a good time, outgoing and open minded.

It'll be a fun night and you won't be disappointed. Looking forward to hearing from you.

PLEASE REPLY WITH A PICTURE and tell me about yourself.
