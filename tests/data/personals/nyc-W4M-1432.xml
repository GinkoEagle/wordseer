  Travel distraction - 20
</title>
<text>
		You and me, laughing on the Champs de Elysee as a small European car with the long license plate speeds past us - pedestrians don't have the right-of-way anywhere, it seems.

You and me, in the Red Square as you try to teach me how to say "Privet", but it just keeps coming out as "Pirouette" instead. We try to become more reverent as we near St. Basil's, the candy colored domes poking the grey sky.

You and me, swatting flies off of our glistening skin as we climb to Machu Picchu. It's the third day and you have to remind me that the view alone will be worth the almost constant state of thirst - and you end up being right.

You and me, alone in a hut that's a part of a resort near Bali. The waves are nipping at the ankles of the wooden structure and we both know just how dangerous the ocean can be, but with the sun setting in front of us it's hard to imagine anything being dangerous at all. 

Distract me from being jealous of the future us.
