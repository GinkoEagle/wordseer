		About Me:

1) 41 years old and CURRENTLY RESIDING IN THE U.S.
2) I have a lovely 4 year old daughter
3) Good work ethic. Professional and dedicated.
4) Kind, considerate, down to earth, and very loving

In search of her Best Friend (preferably British but U.S. Military Great :c):

2) Does not smoke nor does drugs
3) Casual drinker (no alcoholics)
4) Is not in love with himself.
5) Is regularly employed

Please do not email me if you are not interested in a LTR.
The intent is for me to move to the UK (No Visa seekers please. I will not sponsor).
Email exchanges first then hopefully phone calls to follow.

*No Time Wasters Please!!

Please respond with some information about yourself and what matters most to you in a woman. Guys seeking the perfect body, please don't respond. I would like to find a relationship with someone who is seeking a soul mate.



**POTENTIAL SCAMMERS SAVE YOUR TIME.  I'VE HEARD ALL OF THE SOB STORIES.  YOUR VERY FIRST EMAIL REQUESTING MONEY WILL BE OUR LAST!**
