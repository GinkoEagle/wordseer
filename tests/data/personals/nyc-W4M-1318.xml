  Stressed Out in the City - 25
</title>
<text>
		I bring in the bacon, but I'm not getting enough pork.  Looking for a "friends-with-benefits" type of situation.  

You:

Hygienic, Responsible, Mature, Decent.

Dry, Tall, Attractive.

Stressed is ok (but I don't want to hear about your job and I won't tell you about mine).

Friends first; benefits later; discretion.

No doms or married men.
