		Get a hobby? Coming on CL and sending abusive an unwanted email messages to posters is NOT healthy for you. You should be more positive and do something productive with your life. Bullying strangers on the internet is COWARDLY and that means that you are a TROLL. 
I am sorry that your life is so dull that you need to come on here and abuse people to get your kicks..

Maybe you should consider TV work if you have such strong opinions.. Hiding behind a computer will only make you more sad..
