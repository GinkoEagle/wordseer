		Thank you for clicking my ad. 

I am looking for a man that will have all the right qualities. 
A man with whom I can talk about everything trivial, everything deep, everything personal, everything odd and crazy. 

Education -by this I do not mean formal- and proper use of language is quite important to me.  

Intelligence and emotional perception as well, are also very important, otherwise I do not feel we are on the same wavelength. 

Politeness, manners and etiquette are essential as I am fed up with men who can not treat a woman properly. 

Please write an appropriate reply, with no text speech, and please be single, with own job and everything. 

Thank you again for checking this out and best of luck for whatever you pursue
