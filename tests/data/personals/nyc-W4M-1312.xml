		Hi,
Yes, I'm in my 40s and looking for "the one," or at least someone who could be "the one" on Craigslist. Why not hope for the best? With that out of the way, here's my story: I'm an SJF with nice blue eyes, long brown curly hair, 5'3 and, yes, curvy, but not BBW territory. 

You are single (not married or separated, divorced or widowed, with a kid or two is fine), kind, funny, cute by some measure, taller than me and yes, Jewish. Not religious but somewhat affiliated and this is important to me. Sorry if this offends you, but please don't write to tell me how terrible I am--just find someone who's a better fit for you. Most importantly, you're down to earth, up for fun and have a job or at least a career that's maybe on a temporary stall.

Still reading? Then what are you waiting for, please drop me a line.
