  Most men don't get this (Battery Park)
</title>
<text>
		Most men could never understand why you feel the way you do, and that means that no matter how sweet or accomodating they might be, most men can never give you what you need. How could they?

You have trouble behaving when it seems that there's no one to keep you in line, and now that you're all grown up, no one seems to care if you're bad, or lazy, or wasteful, or out of control. The mirror has you believing that you're not a little girl any more, and you don't have a daddy to step in and say "Enough is enough." No one understands how badly you need to hear that, and know a man means it for real.

But I do. I'm tall and smart and handsome and strong, and when you look up into my eyes you'll see I'm not kidding. I'm going to discipline you because you can't seem to do it yourself. 

I'll spank your bare bottom right over my knee, nice and hard so you know it's not a game. And if a hand spanking isn't enough to correct your behavior, then I can use my belt, or even a ruler. Whatever it takes to get my message across and to teach you your lesson. You've been acting up and it's not going to be tolerated any more. I promise.

I'm strict and dominant, but also kind. I'll listen to your excuses, but that doesn't mean I'm going to let you get away with misbehaving.
