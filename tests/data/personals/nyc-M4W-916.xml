  Single black male for dating - 24 (Hofstra campus)
</title>
<text>
		I'm 24 years old living near Hofstra. I'm 5'8" and in shape. I get along with most people, but I fit in best with "nerds" and gamers. I'm looking for a woman of similar age who fits into that group. I don't care about race, I only care that you're single, independent and drama free. If you're interested send me an email. We can chat, trade photos, and exchange numbers if we click. Put "Jake the dog" in the subject and you're guaranteed to get my response. Hope to hear from you.
