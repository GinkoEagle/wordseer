  Dinner and drinks with a gentleman! - 25 (London)
</title>
<text>
		I've been single for a while now, mainly due to being in uni finishing up graduate studies and just not having the time. I'm 25, white, old fashioned (in a good way I hope), average height and weight, and I have a good sense of humour from what other people tell me! I do try to be a gentleman and it's becoming increasingly difficult to do so as women don't seem to be looking for those types anymore. 

Ideally, I'd be looking for a long term relationship but it's best to start off slow and see how it goes. I'm not too picky and do tend to get along with most people so I won't write down a long list of requirements for you to fulfill. The only thing I will say is that it would be great if you were around my age (so let's say 20-30 or so).

I'm free pretty much anytime, even tomorrow (Friday) if anyone would be interested in dinner, drinks and a good conversation! If you could put your favorite color in the subject to help eliminate the spam that would be super!
