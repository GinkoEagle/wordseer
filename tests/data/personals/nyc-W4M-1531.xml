  ***Looking for a date to my friends wedding. You MUST be AWESOME!!!*** - 34 (Right outside the City)
</title>
<text>
		I'm going to my VERY close camp friends wedding August 31st and I would like to take a fantastic, handsome, well dressed man that LOVES to dance (being able to slow dance and dip me is required).
I would like if you have great stories, interesting job and love to travel. We will have a meeting in the city before hand to determine if we are a good fit. Meet me at McSorley's next Tuesday August 13 at 8pm, my two best friend/judges will join us so feel free to bring your gang of equally awesome guy friends so we can ALL benefit from this bold request of mine. 

 Please don't be creepy, please don't be murdery!
