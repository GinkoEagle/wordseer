  BBW spare ticket for 'The Hothouse' - 34 (Charing Cross)
</title>
<text>
		I did a silly thing and rushed headlong into buying a ticket for 'The Hothouse' tonight at Trafalgar Studios tonight as the offer was too good to resist. I can't find anyone to go with and just wondered if anyone was interested in coming with, it doesn't have to be a date and the ticket will only go to waste otherwise. If you send a pic, I will too.
