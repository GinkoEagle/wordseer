  Recently Separated Looking for a New Love  - 38 (woodside )
</title>
<text>
		I was married for the past 8 years, have a beautiful 6 year old baby girl, and my wife just left me for a rich man. 
I am 38, was born in Brazil, 5'8 about 195 llbs. 
I am real and serious about this, I know that CL is not the best place to meet a female that I can fall in love with, but who knows, I have a friend that actually meet someone on CL and now they are married. 
I am a very nice guy with a good family, I would love to meet someone that I can start a relationship that hopefully will last a lifetime. i am not into games, lies, fights or drama. 
I am interested in meeting a brazilian, asian, white or hispanic female. bet ages of 25-38. 
Please be real, no BS. 
I am looking for a serious thing, but we can start slow, i am not in a rush. 
would prefer someone that lives in queens, specially astoria, woodside, sunnyside, LIC, ditmars areas..
