  They Might Be Giants Tonight! - 43
</title>
<text>
		Looking for a fun, laid-back, attractive guy to see They Might Be Giants tonight in Prospect Park. The weather is great and my friends are lame for not going with me! I'm a fun, creative living in Manhattan. Maybe meet for a drink in the city before heading over?

Please send a pic as I have posted one, it's respectful and provides a comfort level :)
