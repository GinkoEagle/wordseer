  Black female seeks music enthusiast - 32 (east london)
</title>
<text>
		Hi. I love music, dancing and socialising. Unfortunately I haven't been to a concert/festival in a  very long time and I really want to go with an interesting guy. I have lots of females friends but not many male friends so I'm hoping that I get a response from a decent, non-pervy guy (having read other ads on this site, it might be a long shot). 

Re me: I'm 5'6, 32 years old, dark chocolate skin, size 14 with big brown eyes. I don't mind doing dinner but I'm looking to meet a professional outgoing and  gregarious guy so hoping to find a guy to go to festivals/concerts with me. I love dance music as well as R&B;,  hip hop and some chart music.

 I'm not fussed about  your ethnicity but would prefer someone from the UK or English speaking country as I'm from London.  I'll only reply to responses which included a pic. Ciao x
