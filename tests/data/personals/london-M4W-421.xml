  Anyone up for a date? - 33 (Herts)

		Haven't done this before but I figured that rather than trawl the w4m category, I'd put one in yours and see if anyone wanted to come and say hi.

Physically, I'm tall (6ft 3ish), slim and white. I went to university, have a reasonable job, own my own flat, etc. It would be good to find someone to share it with though - dinner, cinema, evenings in, etc. If nothing else then it would be nice to go on a few dates, if a first date leads to a second, and so on then that's even better!

So, if you're still reading, come and say hi. I'd be happy to swap photos with any genuine people on here.
