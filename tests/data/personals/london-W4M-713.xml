  American Seeking Englishman - 39 (USA)
</title>
<text>
		I am single, never married, and I don't have any kids. I'm also bored with men here in my own country.  I realize this is a long shot, but it's worth a try.  I am moving to Seattle, Washington (USA). This move will have an international airport so that would mean better airport access if we hit it off. I am 5'0" tall and will chat more about my details if you contact me. I am looking for a loving, caring, loyal, and fun guy to be with. I enjoy movies, music, making new friends, travel, and talking on the phone. All I ask is that my partner will be willing to accept me for who I am even Let's just say that I'm an a unique type of a person...BBW...not super BBW. I almost married someone from London and fell in love with the accent and culture.  I would love to do it again. Having said that, if you're looking for a model or barbie...HIT THE ROAD! That is not me! My shape shouldn't matter anyways, I'm more interested in weather he has a super big and beautiful heart! I am interested in meeting guys who are between the ages of 35 to 50 years of age. If you are looking for some romance, send me a message. To weed out spam or junk mail, simply enter something about yourself such as a drink of choice, favorite sport, or favorite type of music so I know you're real. Please let me know how I can contact you so we can start hanging out. I'm not interested in being sent links to view sites that could put viruses on my machine or something like that. If we click, I do have an international calling/texting plan so we can talk or text anytime.  I'm not comfortable posting pictures here, but will send "clean" pictures if you email me.
