  Smiles and Laughter - 30 (Shelton)
</title>
<text>
		Hi there. I'm a preschool teacher who absolutely loves working with little kids. I live in my very own condo. I am very slowly in the process of writing my own family cookbook as well as starting a business that would have me selling my own handmade crafts. During my free time I enjoy sports (lets go Red Sox), hanging out with family and friends (my family is my life), watching movies of all types (my fav is the Sandlot), baking, photography, traveling, hiking, gazing at stars, kayaking, sailing, going to the beach, mini golfing, listening to music..I listen to a little of everything, mostly rock, punk, and country..not so much rap or R&B.; I also like to write, quote the quotable, play board and card games, whistle, randomly sing (not the greatest, but it's so much fun), wear Crocs, smile and laugh.

I'm a down to earth t-shirt and jeans tomboy with a girlie heart. I like to try everything once and the fun stuff twice or more. I enjoy the simpler things in life. It would be nice to find someone who is into the simple things too. Also, it would be nice if that someone was goal and family oriented, funny, willing to talk as well as listen, laid back, respctful and has a big heart.

PS: Please, please, please be from CT and around my age. Thanks =)
