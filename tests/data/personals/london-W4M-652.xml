  True gentleman sought... (London)

		I feel as though I must apologise in advance as I believe this is going to be a rather long  and detailed post. But in order to find what I am looking for, I think that that should be the case.

Apologies aside I shall now continue with the rest of my post.
I'm looking to be enticed and wooed by sincere and charming man. I am looking for someone who not only I can confide in, but also have fun with and enjoy new experiences. I'm seeking not only a friend, but also a romantic partner in crime. 
For you to be considered qualified for this role, you must be well read, intelligent and articulate with a fantastic sense of humour. You must also not be someone who is easily offended, as I am not. I like people with obscure and non conventional interests as I find these make excellent topics of conversation and also something new for me to possibly partake in. 

Physically I would describe myself as 5ft8 with an incredibly womanly figure. I have cocoa coloured skin with intensely  dark eyes and hair. I have been described as attractive, albeit exotic looking, but I suppose that's for you to decide. You may have noticed that I've left out my age, this is deliberate as I'm rather curious as to how old I'd be placed.
I would describe my personality as being extremely friendly with a good sense of humour. I am bright person and I love teaching myself new things.
My hobbies include reading (I love books, I'm currently reading four at the moment, I alternate between them), I also enjoy visiting the theatre and cinema. I love being in the kitchen (I can imagine some misogynistic readers thinking "That's where you belong") and I'm an avid fan of being experimental (in other aspects also...) with food. 

I'm not judgmental on appearance, nor age but I will admit that I do have soft spot for men with green eyes. If my (somewhat long) post has appealed to you in anyway do send a message and we can take things from there.
Have a pleasant day
