		Hi :)
My name is Jess 
Im 22 years old
Current in college
I am a working girl 
I am a busy girl trying to follow my dreams, I never really have time to meet guys, so I decided to try craigslist.
If I could describe myself I guess I would say I am funny, outgoing, nerdy, loving, energetic. I am so much more, but you should figure that out.
I am looking for someone to be friends with and potentially grow into something more. 
I love an educated man, motivated to go somewhere in life. 
I wouldn't say I have a type, so if you think your interested in me please reply. 
Lets chat, make sure to send a picture and a description about yourself
