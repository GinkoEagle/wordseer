  Some good company? - 26 (London)
</title>
<text>
		This site appears to be filled with husband hunting, man eating, smartly-dressed- men-seeking women. What a tall order! I'd just like some good company, someone who can hold a decent conversation, someone to share a drink with, or to catch a movie with.  Anything that blossoms from that would be lovely, but good company will suffice too. 

If you're relatively easy on the eye, have something interesting to say, and feel that you're fun to spend time with, then get in touch!  ;)
