		Searching for a life partner someone to become my husband. I am looking for someone who is stable in life and race and age are no issues. I would love to start having kids soon as I presently have none and of course get married pretty soon. I am looking for someone who loves travel and willing to visit my homeland and me theirs. I love London especially the UK this is why I am seeking a british guy because they are really sweet people. I am very quiet and down to earth, easy to talk to. Please reply only if you are serious no time for games. 

I travel very often between London UK and my Homeland.
