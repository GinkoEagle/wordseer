  EXTRAordinary  TERRESTRIAL Transports You OUT OF THIS WORLD... 60+  (Spaced in Manhattan, New York)
</title>
<text>
		They say the Earth is over-populated.  
That's true.  Just look around and get acquainted with
the millions of ordinary Earthlings.  To which I say, 
"We don't need any "extra" Terrestrials.
We have enough Terrestrials as it is."

Therefore, I, A UNIQUE TERRESTRIAL WOMAN,
with many attractive features (5'5",out-of-this world
curves, infinite warm feminine wiles, and a gifted imagination) 
can provide A QUALITY MAN, who is SINGLE and looking 
to the heavens in hopes of finding 

Your OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD ROMANCE, with the rare 
opportunity to know me.  
Accept this extra-planetary opportunity to take our voyage of 
mutual discovery, where only your superior mathematico-
physicist-anamnestic-poetical royal route can ever travel to, 

to dimensions where your atrial ventricular palpitations will 
transport you to worlds beyond, to stars yet unknown.

All you have to do to reach me in my rarified stratosphere is to
BEAM YOUR SELF-DESCRIPTION TO ME, including your
AGE and HEIGHT, (ideally you're a middle-aged or older Male
Earthling).  No Martians. No married Earthlings.

And Beam me some other key aspects about yourself, what kind
of earthly work you do, what interests you in your life's terrestrial
existence, what makes you feel happy, and what kinds of music
are heavenly to you.

Then, this Very Feminine Terrestrial will beam back to you more
complete descriptive info about my other-worldly charms, and
about my super-nova intelligence, and about my multi-gifted
careers, and about my eternity of spontaneous original humor. 

Start your rarified atmospheric voyage right now. 
IF YOU'RE THE ONE, May the Force be with YOU to impel
you to reach me before a river of male Earthlings floods my
inbox.  Be Daring and say, "Hello Unique Female Earthling. 
I'm YOUR special Male Being, THE ONE SEEKING ONLY YOU."
