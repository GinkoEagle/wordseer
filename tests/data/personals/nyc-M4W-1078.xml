		I guess I should confess I am attracted to brown women. I really liked that movie

"Something New 2006" I am 49 yrs old have a successful business and own my own home, I

would like to meet my Kenya Mcqueen. LOL. enough with fantasies I would like a friend for

now and see. I am real and looking for a friendship that can grow into something.

If I am sure you are real will give cell number for communications and texting. If you

are like minded and have similar interests, lets give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

thanks for your time and have a good day.
