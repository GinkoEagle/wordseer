		I'm an attractive, intelligent asian (Indian) girl looking for a man who knows how to treat a lady.  Someone who will take me out and treat me well.  It would be nice to meet someone for a few dates and see where it heads.  I am hoping that a relationship would come out of this.  I am only interested in white men (sorry its just a preference) between the ages of 25-40.  Please reply with a picture.  No picture no response.
