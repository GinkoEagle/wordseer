   Broody ? Have my baby  - 34 (London)
</title>
<text>
		Hello,

I'm 34, male, single, fit, good looking, great genes, green eyes, clear olive skin, intelligent, articulate, charismatic, responsible, clean, genuine, honest, comfortably well off, but childless and broody.
My dearest wish is to become a father within the next 12 months, so I can see them grow up into a teenager before I turn 50. But I am not in a relationship and the body clock is ticking... I imagine there are many ladies in a similar situation...

So, if you are and are fertile, I invite you to contact me - the intention is that I will be a sperm donor who will impregnate you naturally. Moreover, I will support you emotionally and financially where necessary during pregnancy and after, but leave you to bring the child up as you see fit as its mother with me having paternal access rights to be discussed further down the road.

Looking forward to receiving responses,
