		Tall, educated, attractive & single Young Professional looking for an Attractive female that is looking for marriage or a long tern relationship. I am attracted to Black,Latin, Indian,females.I was wondering if there are any girls out there who would love to get married to a Young Professional.. thought that I would give this a try..
 I am single and all my life I have been a hard worker and someone always trying to make something better out of myself. I am smart , like everyone...I am mixed and was born in New York and live in the Upper West side of Manhattan..
 I get up everyday to get ready for any challenge, I have a really nice life. I am not rich but I am not struggling but I do have a really nice life.
 I am 6.2 and 180 pounds. I work in Midtown and have a decent job that I love and like I said I am searching now to spend time with someone special
 someone who like me has at least a job doesn't matter what but hopefully you are taking care of your bills and looking for someone to date and hopefully
 get to know each other date and open to the idea of marriage.
 I own my own apartment, I have everything I want, I have my family and I am so lucky , I am fit and really I don't have any worries in my life and I know
 that at this time of my life I would love to meet someone nice. I am not looking for a model , I am 28 but I look younger and I am in good shape. Looking to meet up this weekend for drinks and just to hang out
