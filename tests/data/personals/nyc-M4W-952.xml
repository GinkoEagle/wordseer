  Do you love wearing heels? are you Asian? (and single...) - 29 (Greenwich Village)

		We should talk then, chances are we'll fancy each other. (Maybe you think the heel thing is silly, but to me it's just a way to filter out the not-so-girly gals out there.)

I'm an attractive and tall (6'1 ft) White man, living and working downtown manhattan. I have dark hair and a slim body, love playing sports and staying active. I'm also quite friendly and fun to spend time with.

I do well with the ladies in normal social settings, but I'm newly single and thought this could be worth a shot.
So let's talk? Shoot me an email.
