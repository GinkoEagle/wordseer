  Someone who also prefers to stay up late most nights. - 48 (uws)

		My alertness and zip tend to increase as the day goes on. I'm rarely in bed before 1 AM and often up until 2 or beyond. I like that only a few are still awake. It's a select group. And even better enjoying those early AM hours together.

It helps me that work starts late. The usual job starts too early in the day to suit me, though I would get up early if that were the way for me to follow the money. Admittedly I admire those with early day spark and energy though they do not always get enough sleep.

I'm not part of the late-night bar-hopping set. I prefer the comforts of home, such as they may be. So if you are also a creature of the night, drop me a line. We can burn that midnight oil together.
