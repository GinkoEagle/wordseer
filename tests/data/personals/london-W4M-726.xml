  jokes, tokes and escapism - 30 (London )
</title>
<text>
		Hello, I tend to spend my evenings in the library as opposed to socialising in pubs and clubs. I guess it is hard to reach out in London.  Nevertheless, I would like to strike up a  relationship with someone who shares my interests or at least my desire to get up, out and connect with someone.
I am part bookish nerd part fun loving. The loving fun needs awakening. 
Carribean/irish heritage, busty curvy bbw. 
I'm looking for someone with inner geek who wants to transcend the aesthetic for a more sincere connection
