  American in SF seeking self-deprecating, hilarious Brit.  - 33 (San Francisco, USA)
</title>
<text>
		Hello dear Brits!  
I'm pretty obsessed with you. And the UK. But, I'm not obsessed with the USA, meaning, I'd like to leave. And forever, if possible.  In my case, this can only be accomplished through marriage (never developed that highly skilled worker thing, and not a millionaire - i know, lazy of me, honestly).  

So. I'm really "normal," (which, in my take on the world means I don't dress like I'm trying to get a role on The OC and I have deeper thoughts than what color drapes to buy for my living room),  not so bad looking, of standard size in all directions, inflated sense of humor, kind of a dork, hopeless romantic, emotionally mature and sensible.  
I have deep fondness for: food (chinese, indian, middle eastern, peruvian, and british of course)  sleeping, traveling (backpacking), reading, films, dogs, animals, metaphysics (big buff - Brian Weiss, Campbell, etc.), poetry, friends and wine and good food (think I mentioned food), concerts, history, and all funny stuff.  can play tennis and ski a bit...

So there it is. Desperate cry for freedom.
