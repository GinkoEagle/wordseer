  Caramel BBW seeking a tall white male  - 34 (Downtown)
</title>
<text>
		I'm looking for good conversation with a nice guy who's into curvy/voluptuous/BBW women. I am the coffee shop/librarian kind of female who is totally into the arts scene. I am open to guys who fall within the late 20s to early 40s age range.

I am fairly simple, maternal and looking for the right connection. I'm hoping to find a guy who likes tall mixed-race females, can have an educated conversation, doesn't mind getting to know a lady over time, is employed and preferably is located somewhere in Lower Manhattan or in the Williamsburg/Bushwick/Greenpoint area. 

I don't smoke, drink once in a while. I am drug and disease free - I'd like you to be as well. Please reply back with your picture if you are intrigued.
