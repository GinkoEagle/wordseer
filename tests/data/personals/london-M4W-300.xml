  No love in your relationship?  - 56 (London)
</title>
<text>
		I'm a mature married male, my marriage is not what I would want it to be, but neither do I want to end it
So, I'm looking for a great companion, someone to meet as and when we are both free. You might be in a similar position, just looking to escape for an hour or two?
Nothing heavy, just knowing someone is there for you, to talk to, to know you're not alone...that would be great for me too
So, if this is you, please get in touch. Email to start, build up trust, then maybe we could have a coffee or drink together?

Thanks for reading, a picture would be really nice
