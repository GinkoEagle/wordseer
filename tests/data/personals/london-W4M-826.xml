  Fun, attractive and loving woman (london)
</title>
<text>
		Hello! I have a fun and active life, a great job, and a sweet medium-sized dog. What I'm missing is a special man to share my life with. I'm an intelligent, outgoing, kind, affectionate, attractive white woman. I'm 5'5", size 14, 39 YO blonde hair, green eyes. Divorced 4 years, no kids. I live in the Thornton area.

I am looking for a 35-45 YO man who has a kind heart and affectionate nature to spend time with. Finances, looks and race aren't all that important to me. What is most important is that we have chemistry and things in common, you enjoy being active and social, and are able to support yourself and afford to go out.

I like going out and exploring - whether it be taking a trip to the mountains, trying a new restaurant, going to a concert, museum, comedy show, theater or movie. Camping, fishing and hiking are also some of my favorites. Of course, I also like a quiet evening at home snuggling and watching a movie, or having friends and family over to visit or play a game.
