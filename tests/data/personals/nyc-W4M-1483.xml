  In it for the Long Haul
</title>
<text>
		I am tall, beautiful, super-fit, professional, and all-together. I am looking for a serious-minded SW professional male for a long-term relationship. Ideally, you are tall, fit, good-looking, well-adjusted, happy, playful but serious, and, most importantly, serious about finding someone serious. I have a lot to offer, but really no time for games.

If you are really looking for someone special, send me an email describing yourself and what you are looking for. Pictures can be exchanged. You should be in your 30s or 40s.

And, please, if you are married or hoping to just "get lucky," move on. I am not just looking for a date!
