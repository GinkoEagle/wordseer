		Hi, I'm a single, 29 year old female in search of a co parent. For a while now I've been wanting  to have a child but it is really important to me that the child knows its dad so would like to find someone to co-parent with me.
If you were wondering, I'm 5'8, slim, black with brown hair and eyes. I don't have a type of male in mind, but no older than 40. If you'd like to know more, please message me. Thank you.
