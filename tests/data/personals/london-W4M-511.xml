  American woman seeking partner in crime - 35 (London)
</title>
<text>
		Looking for a partner in crime - but not too much crime, I'm on a visa and would prefer not to get deported.

Must use sarcasm as primary method of communication.  Sincerity severely discouraged - except when talking about feeeeelings, then it's mandatory.  Best of luck trying to navigate that minefield.  

Must be anti-mine.  RIP Princess Di.

You don't need to be rich, but being a billionaire is a plus.   Would prefer yacht but any boat over 40' will do.

Enough about you - on to me.  I am not the female equivalent of the man described above although I once did get a manicure/pedicure.  In the genetics department I lucked out with extreme height (177 cm).

Interested? After reading all that?  Really?  Ok, then.  Drop me a line and send a pic.
