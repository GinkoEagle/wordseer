		Me: So.. im a 19 year old guy who has just finished his first year of university studying architecture and has his own place. Im a 6''3 muscular build. Features..  brown eyes, brown hair around a medium length I guess. I am a honest, caring , genuine guy who enjoys making other people laugh and happy :)

Im looking to get to know a girl that I can take on dates, share things with, cuddle with and just have a great time with. I guess we could start off as friends and see how things work out, see how things go .. but I am looking for a long term relationship, I don't care how far away you live, I have been in long distance relationships before and I will travel.

I am looking for someone that is cute, sweet, caring and honest and just basically nice person. regarding age.. I guess someone between 18 - 26 although im not fussy :)

If you think I seem nice please get in contact as I would love to hear from you :)

Send a picture of yourself and I will send one in return, put your favourite colour as the subject so I know its not spam.

My name is Kai x
