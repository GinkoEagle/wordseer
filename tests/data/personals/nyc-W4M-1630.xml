  The Impossible Dream - 52 (Anywhere)
</title>
<text>
		Maybe not. . .. . .my life is not a bad one compared to most. I am self employed, own my own company. I am not wealthy, but I am not in the red. I am thin, fit, educated, hip, cultured. Like everyone some days are better then others. For the most part I am a happy positive person. . . BUT there is a voice that keeps getting louder and louder inside my head. The voice's message is ever changing, BUT the main concept is always the same. Life is short & there must be more. Now with that being said, the more part does not have to be more things. If the truth be known, as time goes by I want less and less. What the voice keeps telling me is more time for me to do the things I want in my life. It seems all I do is work, and each day I have less and less time to do the things I want. I am a multi dimensional person with much more to me then work. I am an artist, dancer, cook, gardner, writer, poet,lover and most of all dreamer. . .. I must be a really big dreamer or I would not be posting this on craigslist :) craigslist used to be a wonderful venue for dreamers but now not so much. I still believe there are other dreamers out there such as myself that still read craigslist looking for magic. I have the freedom to travel anywhere, and the power within me to transform the quality of my life. What I do not have is the time or the money.. Or the right man. Are you him?
So who are you?? You are between 50-65 a non smoker, educated,( self educated is cool) hip, in shape ( there is a double standard out there). Most of all you must be at a place in your life to do want you want, because you can afford to.. But just need to find the right woman. I am running this post in different cities, because what I am asking for is not easy to find. I know my own self worth, and if you are looking for me you will not be disappointed. Please send a picture and I will send mine. Put DREAM in the subject-line or I will delete as spam
