  Friends or more? - 55 (Midtown East)
</title>
<text>

Successful attorney interested in more play and less work. Join me?  Let's start with coffee, a drink or dinner.  Romance would be great, but new friendships are also welcome.

Single, no kids.  Most people think I'm much younger than my age.  I enjoy the usual NY pursuits -- movies, theater, Central Park, museums, dining out. Also taking tennis lessons, but can't say I play well at this point.

Seek someone honest, funny, smart and single. Preferably between 48 and 59.  No smokers or unlawful drug users please.  Must be able to tolerate a Republican.  

Tell me something about yourself .... Picture welcome but not required.
