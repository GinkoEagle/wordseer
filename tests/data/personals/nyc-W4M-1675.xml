  partnered white female - 29 (brooklyn)
</title>
<text>
		I am a non-single white 29 y/o female who never thought I'd be doing this. I love my boyfriend, but am very unsatisfied in bed. If you can understand, not be judgmental about this and maybe even relate, I would just like to talk to someone, and maybe even see where it goes. I'm at the point where I would definitely be open to cheating on him, yet I can't bring myself to break up with him. I've been really patient and just don't think I can go on this way...
