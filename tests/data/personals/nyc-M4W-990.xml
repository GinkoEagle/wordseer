		Hi! I'm 24, currently running my own business in fashion. I live in the city and most of my time is pretty much dedicated to work, that is the only reason I wanted to try it out here. I personally think most of the people on craigslist tend to be a little weird, I just know from my apt hunting experiences. But i hope someone I can click with happens to see this. Summer was fun but as we get closer to fall, I realize i should look into finding a great date. I live in the city

If you can respond to this ad with a quick photo of you and just tell a little about yourself, I would really appreciate. 

-------I will respond from my company's email which will allow you to see what i do and know that I'm legit.
