  Dreaming of life across the pond - got a boat or plane? - 30 (New York, NY)
</title>
<text>
		I don't know that I particularly subscribe to the term Anglophile, but I am pretty obsessed with making it to the UK. In fact, been trying to get over there several years now, just unfortunately the UKBA seems to think the only way I should be allowed over there is if I am a millionaire, celebrity or Nobel Prize winner. I'm still working on those things, however, in the meantime, thought I'd give this a try. 

I'm not a native New Yorker, so still grappling with life here on the East Coast in my pursuits to make it across the pond. It's pretty crazy here I must admit - everyone works fast, talks fast, eats fast, drinks fast. But so far I'm keeping up.

I'm a nice normal girl, which in my view means I would do anything for my family and friends, don't do things just because the cool people do them, and I have more interest in travel or conversation than going shopping for the latest fashion craze. In fact, I must be one of the only women I know that loathes shopping.

I am friendly, nice looking, good sense of humor, hopeful romantic, emotionally mature and sensible, reasonably intelligent, fairly self sufficient (managed to make it to a decent level on the corporate ladder here in NYC - let's see how long my rung holds out anyway). 

I enjoy traveling, art, films, cooking/fine dining, tennis, watching football (NOT American football), spending time with family and friends, and the occasional spontaneous adventure.

It would be great if you were single or divorced, no kids, no drama (or ideally as little as possible), made me laugh, enjoyed some of the things I mentioned above, and possibly in possession of a boat or plane - or not afraid to hop on one - just to make things logistically easier.

So, there you go... if you enjoyed reading any of this, feel free to drop me a line. Cheers!
