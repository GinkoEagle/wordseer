<LINE>Nay, but this dotage of our general's</LINE>
<LINE>O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>That o'er the files and musters of the war</LINE>
<LINE>Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,</LINE>
<LINE>The office and devotion of their view</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst</LINE>
<LINE>The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,</LINE>
<LINE>And is become the bellows and the fan</LINE>
<LINE>To cool a gipsy's lust.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies,
the Train, with Eunuchs fanning her</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Look, where they come:</LINE>

<LINE>Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.</LINE>
