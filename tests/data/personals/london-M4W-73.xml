		looked on CL, haven't found much, i had plans to go out but they have been cancelled so i go nothing to do this evening, although i am feeling kinda lazy haha. any nice, sane girl interested in dinner and a movie? maybe more if we click? just good company if it dont go past that :D

i'm sure we can find something to talk and laugh about. and im not a bad cook so there are many options to what we can cook, yeah i wanna have a night in, cook something together, have a laugh and a drink, then cuddle up to a movie maybe? 

not too bothered about age and race but no younger than 18 plz!!!!
