  Cool Black Woman Seeks Hip Business/ Professional White Gent - 44 (SW London)
</title>
<text>
		I'm a pretty cool black English woman. Well spoken, great energy and very, very fit 40s (looks 30). Looking to meet an attractive business/ professional white guy for a LTR. It can start as dating and see where it goes but not looking for a casual thing hence ad in this section. 

I'm well read and well spoken. Into the arts, theatre, travel with an open and curious mind. I'm very cool and groovy. Hair and dress for the occasion, from hiking to bars, dinners to curling up on the sofa with you. I'm sensitive, kind and sensual too. If you like black British women as a partner then I'm your kind of person. 

You need to be a graduate or educated from the "school of life", confident, articulate, self made and a bit of swagger and style. I'm more into the smart clean cut, beards or dandies. Will date anyone from 37 to 54.

Please send a recent pic of you being you when you are happy. NO picture will get absolutely NO REPLY.
Thanks for reading my ad.

Pls no: one liners, chancers, time wasters, BS, he-men or bouncer types.
