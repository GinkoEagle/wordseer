  Fairy Tale ending???? - 70 (Upper West Side)
</title>
<text>


Starting with someone who like myself was married, knows relationships can get boring, yet still wants a companion, wants intimacy with a commitment. Someone to depend on to make the last years the best years. An intellectual equal or better, a physical rival in health and fitness, a fellow traveler for the happily ever after. 

No one under 65 years of age please.
