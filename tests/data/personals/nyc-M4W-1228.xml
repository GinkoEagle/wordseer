  A 'Jenna Marbles' truth (Midtown)
</title>
<text>
		You are submissive. You may not want to admit it, may even feel strange about it, but you know you are. You have thought this way for a while now and maybe aren't sure how to act on it. You don't talk to anyone, even your best friends don't know. Past relationships are unsatisfying and don't meet your needs. Even if you tell them what you want, they aren't dominant men and just don't get it and don't understand what you crave, desire, even need. You are not weak. In fact you are most likely a strong, intelligent, educated woman who is in charge of her life and wants to serve and give herself to a strong man. You want to please, obey, serve, give of yourself. You want to be guided, trained, and even corrected if you misbehave or disobey. You want a strong, dominate man to lead, guide, take control in the bedroom. You want to have structure. Sound like you?

I am attractive, very fit, adventurous, affectionate, caring, consistent, firm, honest, and of course dominant. I want that great girl described to be my submissive. I look forward to hearing from you.
