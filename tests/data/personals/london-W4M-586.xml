  Drinks Tonight? - 27 (London Bridge)
</title>
<text>
		This is fairly last minute but if you're around the London Bridge area and you don't have any plans for the evening (or your plans fell through), perhaps you would be interested in having drinks with someone who can hold up their end of the conversation quite well.

Put the name of your favourite drink in the subject line so I don't find myself inadvertently spending the night with a spambot - I'm sure they're lovely but I prefer humans really.
