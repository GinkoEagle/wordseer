  Would you like to have your own family but worry it might be too late? - 40 (South East)

		I just wondered...I turned 40 last month and even though I'm fine with that, I do wonder whether there could be/have been more children in my life. You see, I currently work as a nanny, so life is full of fun and laughter. But still, I feel that something is missing. Oh, I know, maybe I should start writing an ad and see if I can find like-minded men...who knows, maybe someone somewhere might feel the same way?
