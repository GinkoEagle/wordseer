<text>
		I am a woman from southern California who will be moving to NYC soon and I have no friends in New York and in need of soon. I come to NYC often so I know my way around pretty much now just need a friend.

I am a cool down to earth female, I have no children and I just like to chill or go out and hit the town. When I am in NYC you can catch me in Brooklyn and Harlem usually.
