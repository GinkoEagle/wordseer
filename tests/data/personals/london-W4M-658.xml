  Summer Romance? - 28 (London)
</title>
<text>
		I would quite like to have the excitment of falling in love this summer.

I would like to meet a guy around the same age (25-33). He would ideally be intelligent, well spoken, articulate, educated and enjoys being a little bit crazy.

I am 28. I'm spontaneous and wild at times, but also shy and reserved. I enjoy spending my time with people who make me laugh, and do not take life too seriously. If you like art and books, then that is a plus. I work in the city.

I hope to hear from you soon, x
