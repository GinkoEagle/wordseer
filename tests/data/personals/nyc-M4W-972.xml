  I have been called a Father Figure - 55 (Greenwich Village)
</title>
<text>
		Older gentleman, executive, and someone that the college interns and young professionals in the office often seek out for advice. I am approachable, kind, easy to talk to, and have been called a Father Figure by some (and like a Professor by others). Do you need someone to talk to, someone older and stable in your life?  

I am Caucasian, mid-50's and yes married (didn't say happily married). Discretion requested and promised. However, this can be purely platonic (just private). I truly like to help people, and if you need a mentor or Father Figure in your life in the truest sense of the term, just someone to talk to, that is perfectly acceptable. If a closer relationship ever develops, that would be nice but is not a requirement. 

What do you need? Let's email or chat, and if it makes sense we can meet for coffee or dinner. My treat. After all, what are Dads for? :-)
