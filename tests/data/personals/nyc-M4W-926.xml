  Evening convo with author/designer sort. - 49 (East 50s)

		Things feeling expansive here at home - I am ready for a change of pace. How about actual voice to voice communication? That's kind of rare these days. People communicate mostly with keypads and screen, the human element is missing. It is as if they are becoming machines themselves. Uh-oh, maybe they are ...

It's good to practice your talking. Maybe one day your luxury cruise ship explodes or capsizes, leaving you if lucky shipwrecked on an island but everybody's smartphone dead. What would people do?

Hey, looks like already I'm on an island with maybe 2 million other shipwrecked souls (at peak capacity that is). Many are cozily tucked away in hotels, hi-rises, projects or dorms, actually. We could still talk though, Mayor Bloomberg and others all permit it. 

To hear from anyone I am probably dreaming -- but if you interrupt the dream, I will send you my #.
