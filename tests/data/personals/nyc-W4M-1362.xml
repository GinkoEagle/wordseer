  Friday Drinks (SWM Preferred) - 25 (Murray Hill)
</title>
<text>
		It has been a pretty good, productive day. Wouldn't mind ending the day over drinks with a laid-back, good-looking guy. I'm African American, attractive, well-spoken, and witty. No expectations. At the very least it'll be nice to meet someone new.

Cheers
