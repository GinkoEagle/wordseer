  Disciplinarian - 23
</title>
<text>
		I am in complete control of my life, a very independent girl and I make my own decisions. 
But there is a part of me that gets tired of making decisions, that just wants to be told what to do and when to do it. 
That part of me does not want the control, it wants someone else to control me, even though it's hard for me to do so.
I also want someone who will discipline me for my wrong doings. Someone who will spank me for my misbehaving.

I'm looking for a man who understand this and me.  Someone I can trust. Can you be that man?
