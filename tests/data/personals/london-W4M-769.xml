  summer babe - 25 (London)
</title>
<text>
		Hello

After a wintertime of inertia, I am looking for someone lovely to share London with. I love going to talks, performances, and theatre, and I would like to have someone to do these things with. I have plenty of friends already, so I'm looking for scintillating, distinctive company. You must be well read, intelligent, and you will notice things, and you will think. I am/do all these things myself anyway, and I'd love for you hit the ground running. I'm like working on personal projects of interest outside my actual job, and if you have something that similarly puts a bee in your bonnet, that would be nice. Please just be interesting! I cannot stress enough how uninterested in your holiday/pet/office politics I am. I cannot stress that enough. I am 25 and you will probably be somewhere within the decade above this age; I am slim and you should be too.
