		Okay, so let me know if this describes you: 

You're normal, sane, well put together, emotionally stable, and you have no problem attracting guys, but you secretly get cheap thrills by browsing the craigslist personals. You're probably at home now and not wanting to go outside. If this is you, then you're probably laughing to yourself right now. Just guessing also that "you'd NEVER do something like that." Trust me, I understand. I'd "NEVER post an ad like this" too. =) 

About me, I'm intelligent, attractive, laid back, respectful, and looking to enjoy what's left of this night.

If you can relate to any of what I wrote (or if you just like what you see) then get in contact? I know this is "so NOT you," but don't worry, I can keep a secret.
