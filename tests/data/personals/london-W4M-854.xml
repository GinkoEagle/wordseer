		Non formulaic, discerning woman looking for interesting mature man who is prepared to get to know someone before taking things further than social meetings.   I am not looking for an exclusive relationship but additionally not just a one off.  I am mid fifties with normal wear & tear that comes from reaching that age, slim, fit and open minded. You 45+,  able to meet evenings; prefer men over 6ft tall,  slim to average build who know how to read between the lines. You are also likely to read 'proper newspapers' on-line or in print, know the difference between either and neither.  I have a wide range of interests,  circus juggling, bear baiting & imitating teenagers not amongst them; normal baggage but none that impede being available to meet new people.  Few personal hates - scruffy shoes,  miso soup, bad manners, men who call women girls & role play amongst them.  If you value interesting company as much as sensuality then get in touch.  Anyone out there?
