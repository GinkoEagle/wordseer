  Random Thoughts (Midtown West)
</title>
<text>
		Just laying across the bed thinking...how much do we know about the person that we are with? Better yet how much do we honestly know about ourselves?

I come across so many ads...so many rules/regulations...specifics if you will. But are we really capable of giving the things that  we are asking for?

Just thoughts
