  Are you into art house/indie films? I'd like to go out with you - 18 (Midtown)

		I've always been into independent/art house films because so many of them are interesting and bizarre. I'd prefer to see those kind of films with guy, though, so if you're an art house/indie film aficionado, please let me know. What are some art house theaters you like to go to? What genres do you like? I'm pretty open-minded.
