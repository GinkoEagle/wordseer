  Writer or publisher for partner - 22 (Battery Park)
</title>
<text>
		I am looking for a male who is a writer or publisher or knows some agencies because I am a writer and I really want to get my book publish but I need some help. I am also open to dating and getting a meeting I have something really promising and worth millions a contract can be drawn up if you only want to keep this a business thing but I really need help and someone serious or real. I am not joking this is something very serious and real J.K. Rowling was poor and now a billionaire because someone took a chance on her and I need someone to do the same for me.
