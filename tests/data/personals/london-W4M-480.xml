  Fling is better than "Adult friend finder" scammers (Everywhere)
</title>
<text>
		It appears thew adult  friend finder are the ones doing the scamming so put them in the heading and recommend any other site and stop your subscriptions to them.

At least at Fling you get some results so a friend tells me.

Or theres a free one "plenty more fish" anyone know other free dating sites?

I don't work for them!
