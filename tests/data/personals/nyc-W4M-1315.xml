  Younger man? - 52 (NY)

<text>
		An amazing, Caucasian, overall sane, fit, attractive woman has completely gone mad and posted on CL.       
On a serious note, I am looking for an unattached man to date: in his 40-ies, who is tall, fit and would like to meet an exciting gal.  No worries - I will not look older than you.  (Hopefully, you don't have small children and are not planning to have more).
No pressure - we'll take it slow and see if something good transpires.

Sense of humor is a must!  Please, be SINGLE, over 5'11" and don't be afraid to attach your photo(clothes on, thank you). I will respond with mine.
