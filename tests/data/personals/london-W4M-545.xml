		Looking for a Gentleman to get married.
You are successful, tall, older.
I will be a housewife, give you kids and make you as happy and content as you make me.


I am 27, white, intelligent, pretty.
I will answer only if you will attach your photo, tell me about yourself and what is your occupation (plus are you able to take care of financially and happy to have four kids? I want at least four!)


If you are not interested, do not answer at all please, lets not waste each others time :)
