  CHILVARY IS NOT DEAD - 38 (BRONX)
</title>
<text>
		I AM HERE IN THE HOPES TO KNOW A WOMAN WITH  GOOD TRADITIONAL FAMILY VALUES, AND IS READY TO START A WONDERFUL FAMILY, WITH A  GOOD MAN SUCH AS MYSELF. I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A FLING, OR A FLY-BY-NIGHT RELATIONSHIP, BUT A STABLE RELATIONSHIP BUILT ON TRUST, RESPECT, HONESTY, AND A LIFE OF ROMANCE, WITH MY PRINCESS. IF YOU THINK THAT MIGHT BE YOU, REACH OUT TO ME BY FIRST SENDING A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF YOURSELF, AND SOME PHOTOS. IF YOU COULD LEAVE YOUR PHONE NUMBER, THAT'S  EVEN BETTER.
