  A SUMMER HOLIDAY TO REMEMBER - 28
</title>
<text>
		Hi

I`m a 28 year old male. I am a psychologist and I have been living in the UK for my higher studies at the uni. I am from Turkey and I have a holiday house in Bodrum, Turkey next to the sea.

Would you like to have a nice holiday full of sun, sea, delicious Mediterranean food, fun and pleasure with me? We can have a chat about it and find out more about each other. Then if we like and trust to each other maybe we can have a nice holiday together in Bodrum, Turkey.

The only thing you would need to pay for is your plane ticket. It is my own holiday house so you wouldn`t need to pay for a hotel. Also I`m a good cook and I can cook some tasty Mediterranean food for you so you wouldn`t need to pay for any meals too. How does it sound?

I know that it sounds a bit weird because most people wouldn`t trust someone they don`t know and wouldn`t even consider going on a holiday together with him. Also inviting someone I don`t know to my holiday house made me feel a bit strange first. But then I thought that people go on holiday and sometimes they meet someone they don`t know and enjoy the rest of their holiday together. I don`t think that there is a big difference between this and my holiday plans. After finding out more about each other why wouldn`t we do it if both of us like and trust to each other and think that it is a good idea to have a holiday together?

Please reply to my ad if you are interested and would like to get more information and my pic. Even if you wouldn`t like to join me for a holiday I would really appreciate it if you could let me know about what you think about my idea as I respect to your opinions and I would like to know why you reject my offer. Hope to hear from you soon.

P.S. This is a 100% genuine offer and I am not a scammer. I can prove to you that everything written in this ad is real. Thanks.
