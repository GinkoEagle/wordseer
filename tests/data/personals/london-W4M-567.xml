  Fun outgoing British/afrocaribbean female seeks cool guy - 29
</title>
<text>
		I've been single for a little while now so thought I'd give this a go and see who's out there. I'm a pretty outgoing, attractive, professional female. I would live to meet a down to earth fun guy to begin as friends/dating and if the chemistry is there possibly a long term relationship. I don't have a type so feel free to send me a message and I'll get back in touch. Bye for now.
