  any romantic guys who still long to have traditional relationship? - 43 (London)
</title>
<text>
		Is there any real men left who would be interested in a traditional relationship, built up step by step, based on love and respect? Did you realise what happened and why are men scared to take serious a woman? (maybe women also)...but what if we succeed in loving each other? Won`t be fantastic? With trust and support toward each other. Planning our common holiday...having great fun together and even loving each other in difficult times as well? Carry each other...All men singers are singing about romantic love songs...and men never feel like this in real? Won`t you enjoy walking down on the sunny street with someone holding your hand? Won`t you enjoy going out and having new friends together? Figuring out new ways of our happiness? If this is your desire too, please write me your romantic essay about how you feel related to this question. Thanks
