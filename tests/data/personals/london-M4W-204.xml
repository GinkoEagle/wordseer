		Hi

I'm looking for an alternative woman who is into rock as well as other types of music.
Also into animation, manga and all kinds of alternative in stuff.


I'm a black guy from the Croydon area and even though I don't dress alternative I like alternative stuff.
I'm also a writer with a wild imagination.
If you live in London that's fine but if you live in the South Norwood / Croydon area that's even better.

I hope to hear from ya!

Keep it 110%
