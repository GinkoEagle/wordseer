		Hi :-)    

I am a caring, kind, sincere, attactive (so I'm told) person. I believe in all things that make relationships strong and positive such as trust, understanding, honesty, loyalty, kindness and respect. I also believe you have to work at a relationship and marriage and that for this communication is vital.
It is difficult to condense myself into mere words, if my profile has sparked an interest, drop me an email. 
What am I looking for? 
I am looking for someone professional who believes marriage is forever and will work to maintain a positive and strong relationship. 
I am looking for the usual traits of kindness, loyalty, trustworthiness and honesty (Aren't we all?!). A well-balanced outlook of Eastern and Western culture similar to mine is a must, and a good sense of humour. 

Would appreciate a clear photo with reply. 
Thanks
