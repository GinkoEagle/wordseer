  LOOKING FOR A WOMAN WHO IS CREATIVE AND MAYBE INTO ANIME, MANGA (London)
</title>
<text>
		Hi

I'm hoping to meet a woman in London who is creative but into Science Fiction, Anime, Manga and comics.
If you are into soaps more than anything else I'm okay with that I have an open mind.
A great imagination that will help us bond together whether that is friendship or a relationship.


As for me I'm a writer in my late 20s, I'm a black man and just like to have great conversations, laugh like a hyena but keep it real in the same sentence.

Please contact me if you are serious about meeting up thank you.
