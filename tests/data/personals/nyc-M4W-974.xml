		I have finished up one of the last stages of a project I've been at too long, wouldn't mind a nice change of pace.  How about a talk, voice to voice, and it can be silly or it can be sage. It beats texting, which still has its usefulness.

So this is a chance to say hi and maybe get to know each other, with no special expectation. I'm more comfortable not knowing what's ahead, since usually I'm wrong when I think I do. 

We might have a great time talking. I also could be dreaming -- so jostle me and I can send the #.

I am - native NYer, average build, leftish, creative, humorous (well, not incessantly), hazel eyes, good at words and numbers, artistic and musical, like both cats and dogs, nocturnal, can cook.
