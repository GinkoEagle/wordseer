  Just a simple date - 32 (London)
</title>
<text>
		Just searching for an old-fashioned date on Friday evening. A drink, a chat, maybe a stroll if the weather holds.

I am not looking to meet someone who cannot remember if they are 38/40 or someone who is looking for a bit of fun on the side. It would be nice to meet a man who is grounded, secure, with the ability to laugh at himself.

Bonus points if you are interested in languages, satire, or theatre.

So for a carefree night with a friendly, educated, mixed race woman, please get in touch. Messages without face photos will be deleted.
