  Would like to meet a somewhat tech-savvy chick. - 48 (Manhattan)

		I want to expand my life to include a special person to be close with, and also to get my projects and activities more connected to everything now happening online instead of the old ways.

So I seek to improve both parameters at once. To engage with another on the mind level only enhances my affection for someone. 

I'm a creative thinker, but need to get beyond the traditional formats of print and in-person activities and meetings. I need to have, for example, someone to glide me through Facebook - to push me into the pool so to speak and see if I don't sink. I ultimately learn best by doing, but I need outside jumpstart helps to spur my confidence in this age of devices.

For now, technology rules me - but can I get adept enough that I can rule the technology in my world? I kinda wish things could retreat to when technology had a softer impact on people and go directly to romance and its rapture. More and more technology is taking a big part there now too ...
