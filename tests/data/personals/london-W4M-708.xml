		I am searching for a handsome, caring and overall decent guy to spend time with, which will hopefully leads to a meaningful relationship!  You should be professional and settled with a professional job, sincere, kind and love animals. I really do not mind if you have your own children or are divorced as long as we share a connection.  Please be able to spell and speak English!

I am 38, (no dependants or baggage!) in fairly good shape, slim but curvy and work in the city M-F.  I'm very independent and own my own flat, I am just looking for somebody nice to share things with.  Please reply with a couple of clear photos and maybe we can meet for a coffee!  I will send you a photo back by return.
