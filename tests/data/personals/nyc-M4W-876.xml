<text>
		Italian male down to earth, enjoys walks, conversation, cafes, computers, films, day trips, music/poems/romance. Non smoker, non-drinker or drug user, no STD!! educated, full time worker.

 Seeking a good female friend that wishes to go out once and a while, catch some fresh air, parks, - strictly platonic!!! at this stage. 

 I also have a roommate, and we both work and respect our privacy! It is a friendship and only a friendship. I am hoping to meet some new female friends.

 So please drop me a line and a pic so I know your real :)  If your Italian, Asian, polish its a plus** but open to any race
