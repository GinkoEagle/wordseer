  Looking for a respectable man - 39 (Manhattan, NY )
</title>
<text>
		Do you have a job, your own place (or at least not with your mama)?

Really, this is how I have narrowed down my list.  I would be happy with a man who can simply provide for himself.  If I wanted a kid, I would just have one.

So, if you can take care of yourself and want a lady who can do the same then let's meet.

I am chubby...but working on it.  White, blue eyes, blond hair...yes, dyed.  I'm 5'8".  I don't mind if you are a bit shorter but please live in reality.  I met a guy who said he was 5'7" when he was really 5'2".  His mama lied to him and he didn't have his own measuring tape.  Actually, I don't care if you are 5'2" as long as you are man enough to admit it.

That is the key!  Man enough to admit your 'flaws'.  So here's the deal.  Reply with your biggest flaw: physical, mental, whatever...don't care.  Just be man enough to admit it.  Let's go from there.

Photos of your face will get a photo in return!
