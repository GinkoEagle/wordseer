  Me, you & a museum - 30 (Upper East Side)

<text>
		Hi there, 

 I love visiting museums everywhere, but particularly in New York, as so many great ones(no city can match New York for its museums, with the possible exception of Paris) My favorite is the Natural History Museum, what is yours? 

 I am Well educated, am a writer and have lots of hobbies though most of all love great and intriguing conversation! 

 Also has a funny way for us to meet: Trying to join a grad school group where my final remaining task is that I have to find someone whom I have never met and kiss their feet, so silly I know, but could be a good icebreaker, and is unique that's for sure!
