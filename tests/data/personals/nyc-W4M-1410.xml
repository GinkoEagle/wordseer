  sub 46 seeking dom male for serious relationship - 46 (Inwood / Wash Hts)
</title>
<text>
		Look I'm 46, BF full figured not obese..  Im a sub and I want to have a honest relationship with a dominant male that gets me.  I'm trying this because I just cant do the usual dating rituals with my need to be a sub and be respected.  I don't need a married man who just wants fun when it fits into his lifestyle.  If you are a good dom, caring, supportive, strong, real.... than reach out.  Please be 5'10"+, single, race doesnt matter....it about connection.
