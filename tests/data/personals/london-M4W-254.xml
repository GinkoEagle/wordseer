  generous and charming... - 35 (Central London)
</title>
<text>
		looking to set up drinks tonight with a cute female (with the option of dinner - my treat - if we get on).  I'm a charming and witty Irish guy, tall and in good shape, well groomed, avid Daily Mail reader (it's a proper paper, you know), not attached (as of recently) and easy to hang out with.  City lawyer, live near Primrose Hill. 

I'm neither a spammer nor a bot, photo is available for genuine replies.
