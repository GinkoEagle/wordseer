  Wanting/Needing Marriage? - 38 (New York)
</title>
<text>
		Looking for a girl that might want or need to get married. I am in my mid 30s and am ready for a companion.

Rather you are just looking to settle down, or might need marriage for other reasons. I would want it to be

a commitment, meaning not a fake marriage. I would want a partner, and a friend. I don't mind help someone out

but I want something in it for me too. So tell me your position and what you have to offer whatever it is.(not looking for money)

I have a stable job, great friends and family, and enjoy everything New York has to offer.

Race unimportant. Please be in shape and active like myself though. Someone under the age of 38,cute and fun

Put "Wife" in the subject line so I know you are real
