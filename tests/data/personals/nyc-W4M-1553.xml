  Curvy, nerdy girl seeks cool, 420 friendly dude - 26 (NYC)
</title>
<text>
		Hello Craiglisters!

Like so many other women in NYC, I'm searching for that impossibly right man. He is cool, laid back, listens to great music, smokes good stuff and likes to laugh. I spend lots of time reading textbooks and scientific journal articles- so it would be refreshing to talk to someone who studied or is involved in Music, English, anything that is far removed from an agar plate. Age, really isn't a factor, I prefer to connect with men that have varied interests and would like to introduce me to new things.

Hope to hear from you.
