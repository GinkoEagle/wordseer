		I've been browsing craiglist for a week or two and have never quite been sure which ads to reply to, am I looking for a relationship or am I just after no strings fun?

Part of me thinks that no strings isn't really fun, well OK maybe sometimes it is but a bit of a connection, which comes from something more long term sure helps... or is that just me? I'm hoping my female equivalent is out there thinking similar things and browsing craiglist as well, perhaps you?

I study, eat, sleep, drink and do all the usual things in life. I have a ragbag bunch of interests and wouldn't mind meeting someone to share my existing ones with as well as perhaps stealing a few of hers, so if you don't mind sharing why not get in touch?

I'm 6ft3", dark eyes and dark features. 92KG, Toned arms, legs shoulders, with a bit of a chubby belly.

OK, I'm typing but not really saying anything but if you're reading and hearing something... that's great!

your photo gets mine and all that jazz :)
