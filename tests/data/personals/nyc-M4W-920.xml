  Broken heart again. 
</title>
<text>
		Why can't find someone to be there for me. I ended a long term relationship after finding she was unfaithful. Now after a few months a find someone new but after I though things were going well she pulls away. I tried to prevent myself from falling in love but I did. Now I feel once again so lonely.  Everyone see an am attractive tall professional male but they don't see the loneliness I feel. My heart has been trampled so many times that I'm so much pain.  All I want is to have a relationship with someone to love me and I would love back.  Can someone please help me forget her. Now all I do is cry in bed.
