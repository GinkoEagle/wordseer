  What are the odds? - 50
</title>
<text>
		There are about 8.3 million people in New York City.  So there should be about 4 million men
and at least 500,000 mean in my age range.  However, more than half of those men are likely already 
married or involved.  Then the gay guys need to be eliminated. I estimate that means I am left with 
about 150,000 potential dates. If I can even meet 1 guy every day of the year then it is going take  410 years for me to meet everyone.  I guess I really need to get started and I also realized I need to create an 'app' for this.

Me.  I am 5'2", slim, considered cute, considered smart.  In addition to an affinity for numbers,  I try 
to keep fit at the gym and informed with the news.  I always enjoy exploring a new restaurant or
store in New York and would love to have someone to explore some exotic or not so exotic country with.  Although I have none of my own, I have a fondness for children and dogs and they seem to like me as well.

You are one of the 150,000 and are considered cute, smart, fit and funny.  You are looking for a 
relationship and if you tried to validate my calculations then we likely have equal, but charming,
minor neuroses.  If you write soon enough then we can plan something else to do in the next 410 years.
