		Hello

I am a mid 30's lady looking for a man to join me on the journey of my life! To start with I have to tell you that I am a mother and my children live with me most of the week. I am currently unemployed and stay at home looking after the children as well as trying to better myself and find a job that can fit around my life.
I have had a full life and have seen and experienced a lot of things but now I am ready to settle with that one special person for the rest of my life.
I enjoy reading, learning new things, cinema, cooking and eating out. I don't get a chance to do most of these things and am looking forward to meeting someone who can show me new just what London has to offer.
A little about me, I am 5ft 7in tall size 12-14. I do not smoke and drink very occasionally. I do not do drugs and will not tolerate being with someone who does.
I am looking for someone who is ideally mid 40's and not scared to send me a picture as well as make the effort to write something about themselves to me. 
I welcome replies from all mature gentlemen, irrespective of colour and religion. 

Thank you for reading my ad and have a great day!
