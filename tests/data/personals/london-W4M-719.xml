  LTR - 20 (Long-Distance)
</title>
<text>
		I'm 20 years old, hardworking and living with parents. I have such an open mind about life, and I hate the mere thought of settling for less aka the lousy, pitiful, small and simple-minded men of the south, who happen to be so set in their 1876 ways. Things are black and white here, and I'm yearning for men in color. I'm very artsy. I'm a starving artist, looking for my acting break. I love to sing, dance, act and perform. I have a good job! It pays the bills. I am hysterical in the eyes if others, and I do tend to cracks self up. I am a Christian. I am looking for something so real with a man and so powerful. I want to meet a man in a big city who has been through life as much as I have and knows most of the ways of the world and how to charm a lady and keep her smiling. I like men of all ethnicity. I do not limit my opportunities due to race, weight, distance or occupation, but I will not overstep the boundaries of age difference. I am 20.I DON'T DATE MEN OVER 28!!.. I am an African American, with a strong American accent. I love America. Our differences make us unique, but having a lot in common is a plus. I'd like to meet a man from a bigger city, talk and connect, and meet him when I go to NYC in August and if things work out, we get serious and it could be my reason to believe in hope for a real relationship, instead of settling for what's here. The relationship I in search for, is one that has the potential of a content and happy marriage in the near distant future. Why date, if there's nothing to work towards? I'm looking for a relationship that's new and exciting, and even when it gets old, it feels new everyday. That's what I want. I want a man to make me his. i want to have fun and fall in love, finally. If you email me with your perverted talk, I will immediately filter your email, and you'll be steps further away from not being single and desperate. *******Email me a picture of you******** and tell me about yourself and your input on dating and relationships and if I like what I see and hear, I will email you back! Thanks!
