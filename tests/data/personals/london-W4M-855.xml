  Are you an alpha male? (Central London)
</title>
<text>
		Hi,

I've always been attracted to alpha males...maybe because I like a man to be and act like the man of the relationship and prefer traditional gender roles relationships. So I'd love to meet a nice, single, tall, professional guy in his 30-40s who thinks himself an alpha male and looks to make things much more exciting in life. 

I consider myself charming, confident and refreshing. I am smart, post-graduate educated, tall, attractive, and approachable.

So if this appeals to you send me a message. If not, good luck in your search.

Thanks
