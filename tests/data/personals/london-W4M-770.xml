		Hello

I am currently in an unsatisfying situation. I want to meet a man with confidence, intelligence and curiosity. You'll enjoy reading, exploring, and theatre, as well as having a few hobbies and interests of your own. You may or may not be attached; I'm a busy bee and whilst not looking for something seedy, I'm certainly after something relaxed and easy. No baggage. Please be 28 or over.

In return you'll get me! I'm all the obvious things you'd expect me to say at this juncture, as well as articulate, curious and opinionated.
