  A breath of fresh air... - 38

		For whatever reason, I have decided to post an ad on Craigslist in New York even though I am not in the area. I just thought I'd get that out first so you can go on to another post if that is an issue with you.

I found myself browsing the ads here while drinking my coffee this morning just to see if they were different than the ones in my area. All in all, they are not. Different geography and different dialect, but it basically boils down to the same human desires.

I also found that there were some I wanted to respond to but thought it somewhat inappropriate due to my distance from New York. I guess I consider it a little rude or misleading or something along those lines. I figured it would be best to place an ad that prefaced the distance issue.

The kind of man that appeals to me is typically professional, clean cut and clean shaven. He possesses a quick wit with a healthy dose of sarcasm. Communicating well comes easy for him as he values its importance. He does not take himself too seriously while still knowing when being serious is required. That is not all, but I think it's a pretty good start.

I consider myself intelligent, articulate, open-minded and an overall good and decent gal. I love to laugh and smile and try to do those things often. I am a lady that still feels like a girl. I have some grit but am not abrasive. I am put together even when it may not be that way on the inside. Again, that is not all, but I think it's a pretty good start. ;-)

I realize that my post is likely to get lost among all of these, but perhaps I have shared enough to have piqued your interest. If so, I do hope that you message me. 

As far as a physical description goes, I stand at an above average height for a female, am slender and am considered attractive. I figure a little bit of that information is something you'd be interested in knowing.

Again, if you feel so inclined to respond, please do. I would like to hear from you. 

All the best!
