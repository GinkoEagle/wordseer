		Is it possible to have a relationship and maybe even get married if you have a physical disability ? I am not sure. I myself am a totally genuine loving devoted woman
I'm not looking to run a marathon or go hiking , but I would go to a movie , out to a quite romantic dinner , cook dinner , simple enjoyable things in life. I also do like the finer things in life. I am family orientated also yet more reclusive and a homebody ,cuddling watching a movie is fine 
If you are accepting  47-57 looking for a relationship built on true solid friendship , than I'd really appreciate an e-mail  from you.
