  Lingerie and literature... - 30 (London)

		Hello there,

Well, I won't bore you with an essay and so I shall get straight to the point. Which is:

Sane, genuine chap who is (or has at least been described) as being smart, funny and attractive would like a little summer distraction. Sadly, much too busy for anything 'too serious', so not on the hunt for a future ex-wife, but quite like the idea of enjoying the company of a like-minded (female) soul, who's also keen on the idea of a little adventure and who likes good books, good music, good lingerie and good conversation holed up in some old man pub..

Over to you then..
