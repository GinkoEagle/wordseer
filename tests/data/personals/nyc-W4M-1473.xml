  GIVING LOVE ANOTHER TRY - 30 (NJ)
</title>
<text>
		Biracial female but consider my self black looking for a long term relationship hopefully marriage, I am 30 yrs old I live in NJ will date someone who lives in NY never know where you'll will find love right???? Race is not a factor with me as long as he treats me with respect. I am open to men that are older than me but not too old to the point he can be my father :)  I am looking for a man that know what he wants doesn't play games and not a man that looking for another one night stand or another girlfriend or mistress.

PLEASE REPLY WITH A PIC AND I WILL DO THE SAME
