		Very genuine ad from a decent guy. 

Divorced guy, professional, hard working, straight, late 30s, 5'10 not fat and not skinny. Kind and caring with blue eyes and a cheeky smile. 

Looking for a girl that would be happy to meet, hopefully regularly, for long chats over wine, some time to laugh together and some mutual unwinding and stress release. 

Maybe if we get on well, some weekends away?

A strictly no pressure arrangement, just doing what feels comfortable.

Would you welcome an excuse for an early night every now and then? ...or a reason to set the alarm for half an hour earlier than normal in the morning? 

Maybe it can all start over a coffee and we can see if there is that spark there? 

Drop me a note. 

This could be great fun.

PS: Please don't contact with anything to do with money... That's not the arrangement I have in mind.
