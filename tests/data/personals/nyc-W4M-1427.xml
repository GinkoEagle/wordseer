  SBF for SBM - 23
</title>
<text>
		A friend suggested I post here. I was a bit hesitant, but here goes nothing:

23 y/o sbf, 5'6", "thick" (i hate the term, but I'm not skinny nor am i bbw. so, that's the best way to describe me), college educated (heading to grad school soon), employed, independent, no kids, etc.

I enjoy movies, music, traveling, cooking, working out (at least 3-4x per wk), reading. The list goes on. I'm an adventurer so I love trying and experiencing new things.

I'm looking to meet someone chill, driven, independent, and of course handsome (it's virtually impossible to date someone and not be attracted physically).

I'm allergic to cig smoke, so please no smokers. 420 is ok in moderation (no pot heads/druggies please).

I've encountered a lot of aholes, so I'm ready for something different. So show me what ya got CL!)

No pic, no response (and of course I will reciprocate).

Please be within my age range 23-30

Not here looking for a hookup, so don't contact me for that.
