  Motivational encouragement. - 76 (London)
</title>
<text>
		If you are a student who feels that you might benefit from some motivational encouragement involving old fashioned discipline from a nice but firm grandfather in his 70s, then please contact me so that we can discuss your situation, and any remedial measures which might be necessary to help you refocus.

Happy to help. Somebody's got to do it!
