		So here I am online, looking for my best friend. I have found myself going on date after date, but never finding anyone of substance. I want more more than just drinks. I want someone who holds my hand and looks into my eyes. I am a strong, successful, attractive, but also sweet woman. I want a match, someone who has it all. Educated, successful, funny, hardworking but playful, and also someone who is patient and kind and has a good heart. Do you like mini-golf and lazy Sunday afternoons? Do you work hard, but know how to let your hair down too? Can you teach me how to golf? Do you love the beach? Can you meet fire with fire? Like I said, I am a strong woman, but I am worth it. Looking for my best friend in a city full of crazy. Me: Cute, Blonde and Curvy. Serious replies only with a picture. Ages 32 - 42 and 6'+ please.
