  Whew, I thought I'd never find you!  - 52 (Yes!  It's me!)

		I am looking for a relationship. Not just any relationship, but I am looking for IT. Sparks. Companionship. The whole nine yards. Will I find it with a random online posting? Who knows...but what the heck.

I am NOT looking to hook up, not looking for a pen pal. 

About me? I am white and easy on the eyes and I have a nice figure.  And I am pretty open minded but I just don't think I will find that spark with you if you are more than a couple of pounds overweight or if you are politically conservative.  I am very open and honest and if I don't get that back from you, we just aren't going to work out as a couple.  

If you want to respond please be between 47-57. Please send me a coherent response with some substance. I will not answer emails that read "So uh what's up?"  

Thanks :) Have a lovely weekend!
