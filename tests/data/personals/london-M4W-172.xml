  Caring guy seeking a nice woman for a happy future. (London)

<text>
		I'm really not great at filling these in but I'll give it a go! I'm a mature minded 23 year old who is very honest and caring. It's been a long while since I've been in a relationship and was hoping to meet a lovely woman and see what the future holds for us. I graduated from university a few year ago and have been working since then and unfortunately abandoned my personal life. Hence, I am looking for someone I can enjoy a walk with in the park, go out for a meal with or just curl up on the sofa and watch a movie with. Ideally you would be around my age group but if you are a little older I will not right you of so feel free to drop me a few lines! I look forward to answering any further questions you may have or just engaging in a conversation with you and see where it leads.
