  Friday night inspiration - 31 (Anywhere in London)
</title>
<text>
		Hi,

I'm at a complete loose end this evening and I'm looking for some inspiration and a partner in crime to share the evening with.

Bearing in mind we live in the greatest city the world; there's surely got to be something exciting, stimulating and fun we could find that could amuse us?

Me in brief, I'm 6'2 office build. Into all the usual things, quality music (it's all completely subjective isn't it) & going to live music, occasional box set consumption, regular cinema goer etc. Slightly on the geeky side of things in terms of tastes I suppose, but not really in appearance.

So, what about you?

If any of this sounds remotely appealing or interesting, drop me line and let's see if we can't piece together a brilliant Friday night.

Adios
