  Tie up a well educated person for a good cause - 30 (Upper East Side)
</title>
<text>
		Pretty well educated, speak 5 languages...I simply love intelligent and witty conversation! The kind that can go on and on as the time flies by.

Let me get to the silly, I am joining a group in my grad school that calls for a pretty crazy task. I have to met someone who would be a stranger in terms of never meeting them before and let them tie me up. Total trust game, I would stay clothed, you would stay clothed (you could watch TV or be on the net while I am tied up) I just can't be able to get out(hence the trust part) 
I have had to repost this as you should see some of the responses I have gotten, I have seen Law and Order episodes that have started this way :)

Such a crazy task, but I figure anyone who is willing to be so nice to do such a thing, is exactly the kind of person I want to be meeting anyway! 

So what do you think?
