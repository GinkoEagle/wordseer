  Any August plans? - 24
</title>
<text>
		So I've got some big deadlines mid August and will be very busy until then but want to start planning some fun times to celebrate for afterwards. 

Thinking I might be up for meeting someone new then also, if we're on a level and you can suggest something tempting enough. So let me know your ideas if you fancy taking a young, tall and slim Russian brunette out somewhere. 

Preference for smart, tall and cultural gentlemen. 

PLEASE NOTE: this is not a dating call and does not entail any intimate offers- those will go straight to junk.
