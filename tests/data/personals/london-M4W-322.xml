  Can we maybe help each other out? - 42 (London)

		So maybe you're a student, or an intern, or someone who just can't make ends meet... maybe we can help each other...I'd like to have a lady I can spend some time with in an intimate way once or twice a week.. you're not a professional, and would never do that kind of thing... but an exclusive FWB type relationship would suit......

If any of this, or all of it, strikes a chord, and you are normal and sane, and not a game player - I am genuine, and I am looking for someone genuine... let's get chatting and see if we can help each other out.

If you send me a pic, that would be good so I know who I am typing to, and I'll send one back... and let's be honest, there has to be mutual attraction or it's not gonna work - the Friends bit is as important as the Benefit bit :-)

Look forward to hearing from you
